silent and traceless But the ancients thought that &quot;one day passes and one day 
gains&quot;, which is sad. I wonder if it is possible? On September 5 (1984), teacher 
fan wanted to keep a diary, so he thought he had lost something<br>

I have kept a diary and learned to choose a auspicious day (National Day), but

Before the evening self-study, I was sending a book to class 2, lihongtao. I was 
looking at the back door. Suddenly, I felt that someone had patted my right arm. 
Suddenly, I turned back and saw that it was XURUI. I was delighted. So I held 
hands, smiled and asked her if she would go back In fact, I knew he would go 
back So we went to my class and talked about our former classmates. Now we are 
in all directions. What do you think Speaking of his shoes, a slipper cut from 
sandals, but there is a big hole in the instep. I said who wanted to breathe (he 
said it was someone else&#39;s), so he laughed and said with joy that I looked good. 
I listened to dark music, didn&#39;t I? A long lost friend? At this time, the light 
was on, and he left. Then I suddenly felt that I had lost something. I was 
empty, so I took out my books and read them!<br>

At noon, there was a lot of crowding. When I came to the door of the 
experimental building, I felt a voice calling me. Looking around, I thought I 
might call someone else, but the voice clearly made me ring Seeing that it was 
Xie Xuejun in the building, he remembered that he wanted to borrow a dream of 
Red Mansions from him. He was very happy to go forward and have dinner as usual, 
so he asked him, &quot;Sanzi, do you have a dream of Red Mansions?&quot; &quot;Want to see it?&quot; 
It was smart. I said, &quot;my sister borrowed it. Maybe my father doesn&#39;t allow it.&quot; 
&quot;You said so and so teacher see&quot;, &quot;teacher has not yet?&quot; He smiled and I knew it 
was prevarication: &quot;nonsense, how could the teacher have?&quot; I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s 
broken. &quot;I&#39;m alone.&quot; he didn&#39;t speak and smiled. I don&#39;t see any hope. I&#39;m 
afraid of trouble. At this time, when the meal was over, they went to wash each 
other&#39;s pots. When he came to the dormitory, he told Tai Chenghua that I would 
watch a dream of Red Mansions. You are a good three sons. If you don&#39;t borrow 
them, you will return them.<br>

Today, just after the evening self-study, there was a sudden power failure, so 
there was a commotion. The students went out of the classroom one after another. 
At this time, the cries of people, people shout, the sound of desks and stools 
being knocked, filled the building, and I also went out of the classroom. 
Looking from the railing, the lights of Jurong City were all off, only the 
lights of the fertilizer plant in the distance were flashing, and the moon was 
surprisingly good (the 12th day of the lunar calendar), making the ground very 
bright. The students went downstairs and made fun of each other. After a while, 
many people walked around the playground and the parallel bars were full of 
people. I was admiring the moon. The moon was surrounded by white clouds on 
three sides and was moving slowly. However, the clouds away from the moon were 
like huge scales, shining brightly. In the moon, I could clearly see the shadow 
of trees, which were round and bright, flashing a little red light, like a small 
sun. At this time, when the wind blew, I suddenly remembered a sentence: &quot;the 
sound came from the ear, the color came from the eye, and the use of it was 
inexhaustible.&quot; &quot;The bright moon and clear wind are priceless, and there are 
ancient couples among famous poets,&quot; he said At this time, Qin Bin and Li 
Erqiao, who had just transferred from Dazhu Middle School, came, So we talked 
about Zhuo Zhonghe and Huang Zhong. Qin said &quot;living on both sides of 
Hongcheng&quot;, but I was silent. After talking for a long time, I said, &quot;how many 
teachers and classmates do you have to meet from primary school to university?&quot; 
they both praised Qin bin. Qin bin talked about his favorite teachers. I asked 
me, but there was no one. I was surprised.<br>
<br>
At nearly 9 o&#39;clock, a call came, so he entered the classroom for self-study.<br>

Yesterday, when the self-study period expired, I had a conversation with Tai 
Chenghua after going to bed. The light went out, so the dormitory calmed down. I 
turned around and was ready to go to sleep. But I suddenly thought of Chen Gang 
(Xu Qian), so my sleepiness disappeared. When I first met you. At the beginning 
of school, I like to meet new friends. When I saw him, his hair grew a little 
and his ears were covered. But when they shook their heads, they could see that 
the ear skin was white and tender, wearing a white shirt and a moderate figure. 
As soon as he turned back, I was intoxicated. His face was like a picture, and 
his hair was as big as a mirror. The white and tender face is round and square, 
without beard, with white lips and red lips. It has a beautiful nose and sky 
carving. Its eyes contain autumn, and its red eyebrows are patched. From the 
side, it can be seen that his white teeth are all present when he talks. It is 
gorgeous and charming. There is only an old saying to describe it: &quot;his eyes 
contain autumn water, and his eyes are alive, and his heart is connected.&quot; 
Walking is free and easy. So I made friends with him, never forgetting when we 
saw him, and thinking like crazy. He likes every move and every dress. Day and 
night, I think, so I just don&#39;t sleep. I live with him and develop my career 
together. And then it really shouldn&#39;t be, only sigh one thing. I don&#39;t know 
when to sleep. After a while, I woke up again. Because the mosquito was biting 
badly, I put down the tent and thought of him again. I scolded him secretly. It 
was already light and I tried to sleep for a while. The next morning, I woke up 
weak and told him when I met him.<br>

Today is Sunday. I listened to the radio with Chen Bin this morning. In the 
afternoon, I played table tennis with Qin bin. At first, I didn&#39;t get used to 
it, and then I got better. He knew he could compete with him. After playing for 
a long time, he was sweating and his back was wet. Me too, I think. After that, 
I wrote my composition. After a while, Xu Rui came. I was very happy. I 
immediately put down my pen and went out. I forgot to put away my book, and even 
regretted being read on the way. He just came home. I asked him to bring his 
clothes (for money). He told me that my mother wanted me to go back on the 
national day. He put his clothes on my bed and took out a bag with three pieces 
of moon cakes. My heart was warm. He gave me three yuan, one of which was made 
up of several hairs. I was nervous and wanted to buy pants at home. At this 
time, I could not help blaming him. What can I do to repay this? &quot;Go back,&quot; I 
thought. How nice it is to grow up early and earn money for your parents! I look 
forward to that day.<br>

Before the self-study this evening, Chen Bin and I went to class. Upstairs, we 
saw several people pulling a dead tree dug up with ropes. They were shaking and 
falling. Chen Bin said, &quot;this is called pulling down&quot;. I have an exciting and 
interesting word. Pulling down was originally a daily term. It refers to a 
reproach that he could not start because the other party didn&#39;t respond. 
However, he cleverly used it here. He pulled the tree down with ropes and pulled 
it down, I praised him. He held his head up quietly, and his pride came out of 
his face.<br>

In the third class this afternoon, teacher Fei asked several students of our 
&quot;Chinese interest group&quot; to go to the Chinese group for a meeting. We went there 
and looked through the things. I especially found a pile of sugar on his desk. 
It was very comfortable. After a while, teacher fan came. He asked us to sit 
down. Teacher Fei was there. First of all, he said that we should organize and 
be led by teacher Fei. Then he asked us to write an article about the national 
day and strive for the newspaper. I thought: I was about to have a try, so I 
conceived it.<br>

This morning, the school resumed the daily exercises between classes, so we all 
lined up on the playground. The school leaders, head teachers and PE teachers 
all came out. Some shouted and some Ran East and West. We moved around. I 
suddenly remembered Teacher Wang&#39;s words: &quot;all the ghosts and ghosts jumped 
out.&quot; So he told Li Erqiao to laugh together. After a while, our class teacher 
came. He looked up high, and we said: cadres who are more cadres than cadres 
came, and burst into laughter. They lined up and dispersed. During the 
self-study, the head teacher asked me to write an article to the blackboard 
newspaper, and said that many teachers said my benefits, but I was at a loss. 
What benefits did I have to be told by what teacher? Since there are many, I 
will never be a teacher. I can&#39;t find the answer. But I still thank them for not 
forgetting me.<br>

At noon, we all came to the class. Soon, under the leadership of the head 
teacher, we went downstairs to move the gravel. Li Erqiao and I found two Jibo 
movers and claimed to be the first and second teams. After a while, I found that 
the teacher Xie Dingcheng asked a person for directions, so I went up and 
shouted &quot;Xie teacher&quot; and &quot;looking for Sanzi?&quot; &quot;Hmm&quot;, so I went upstairs to have 
a look. No, I took him to the dormitory. On the way, he told me that when they 
went to school in the county, the classroom was our current dormitory. Soon I 
found Sanzi, and I went to work again.<br>

When we were doing morning exercises, we just lined up. A tractor was climbing a 
small post. Several times it didn&#39;t get on the post. Several workers were 
pushing it hard, but the teachers who taught students all day stood by one by 
one. Later, several more workers came to push it on. I see. Maybe some young 
teachers want to push, but due to the face of the school leaders, I hope it is 
possible.<br>

trade union, where I saw some old people playing chess, and then I saw kangleqi. 
I felt bored. Tai Chenghua went to play ball. I saw a move, and the car was 
never able to sink. Only then did I know that I was nearly cheated and had a 
good move. Later, he went to his friend&#39;s house to read Zola&#39;s novel. When he 
returned to school, he watched the TV &quot;female slaves&quot; and went to bed.<br>

This afternoon, the class meeting was held to select cadres. The teacher 
mentioned some temporary cadres and some good students. Later, he said that my 
teacher reflected that I was good and that my study was OK. I didn&#39;t hope. So 
they chose several students in groups. Someone mentioned me, but I blocked them. 
They wouldn&#39;t let me. They wrote about seven male students. I said I should 
write about a female student, so I took the paper, crossed me out and wrote 
about a female student (stipulated seven). They could not help blaming me. I 
think it would be a shame if a group had me. Later, in the statistics of the 
four groups, there were three groups with me. I was delighted. Except for the 
four groups with Tan Derong, the rest were all three groups. Later, by a show of 
hands, there were 41 people in the class, but 36 people voted me as the second. 
I didn&#39;t expect that my classmates would believe me, and I was surprised to find 
that Xu Qian also gave me a lift, so proud. The teacher said that the teacher in 
grade one of high school responded well to me. After the class committee 
meeting, the head teacher said that the teachers&#39; response was good. Later, when 
Chen Bin and I went back to the dormitory, we met the head teacher. He stopped 
me and said that the teacher had a good response in the past. It was unexpected 
that there was so much warmth besides the warmth of my parents. Can I keep it? I 
don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t feel it!<br>

After having lunch with Chen Bin and Li Erqiao this afternoon, I went to the 
third floor of the experimental building for dinner. When I got to the corridor 
on the third floor, I fell down a piece of rice and thought I was unlucky. After 
eating for a while, suddenly Zhang Daoping came up with a meal. I was inspired 
and thought of hitting him with a meal. He quickly picked up the rice and took 
it to the railings. He happened to be under the railings, so he threw it down. 
It happened that he was hitting his head. We laughed to ourselves, hid 
ourselves, and called him when we saw him. He turned around, but didn&#39;t see us. 
(later, he said that he hadn&#39;t found it at that time, and it was Li Erqiao who 
told him), so the three of us laughed.<br>

When I got up this morning, I did a lot of cleaning and did not do morning 
exercises. I cleaned the window and said it was for the inspection. In the 
afternoon, the head teacher posted a temporary schedule. The original 6.30 
morning reading was changed to 7.00, and the original 9.30 self-study was 
changed to 8.55. I said it was for inspection. I tried to say, &quot;tell the 
inspection team about this.&quot; (on the surface, the teacher asked us to report to 
the inspection team truthfully), &quot;this can&#39;t be said,&quot; he said. Cough, cheating? 
Cheating yourself?<br>

Today, in physical education class, we played volleyball before class (my first 
time on the court). When we played, I unexpectedly received several balls 
abnormally and deducted four or five balls in a row, which won the praise of the 
onlookers. It turns out that I still have talent in this regard? In physical 
education class, we went to play ball. This time, we didn&#39;t have a good time. 
Because the field was large, we only served on both sides, and there was little 
fierce competition. When we were going to leave the court, I successfully served 
several balls and won several points in a row. We won 3:2 in the first three 
games, and 7:9 in the last game. At this time, class was over, and we left. It 
turned out that I could play volleyball. I think.<br>

After finishing their homework at noon, Chen Bin and Chen Bin took volleyball to

played a game. The Taoist student also came. So they started to fight with each 
other on one side. Naturally, they had to shout loudly. At this time, a teacher 
said keep your voice down and people slept. We kept a low voice for a while. At 
this time, many students came one after another, so we officially played. It was 
not very easy. I served and scored a point. It was already 10:12. The other 
party also scored because of the service. At this time, Mr. Wu of physical 
education came and wanted to receive the ball. He said that it would affect 
people&#39;s sleep. We had no choice but to have a pity.<br>

Today, during the break exercise, Mr. Wu said on the radio that we should line 
up for each class when we go in and out of the field during the break exercise 
on the 24th. We thought it was a lot of trouble, because we usually broke up in 
a crowd. Mr. Wu said that as long as we persisted for one day, because the 
inspection team came that day, he said that we were disciplined. Thanks to what 
he said: show it. It is said that in order to maintain the reputation of &quot;key 
middle schools&quot; and &quot;make small moves&quot;, I think.<br>

Today is Sunday. I was listening to crosstalk in the morning when Li Hongtao 
shouted. I looked at him, but there was a man behind him. Looking forward, it 
was my mother. So I was so happy that I went forward and called &quot;Mom&quot;. She 
twisted a bag in one hand and told me, &quot;go, buy you clothes.&quot; I was not allowed. 
She said she had come on purpose, so I went with her, walked through the 
department store, walked through the vegetable market, and came to the clothing 
store. She asked me to choose. There were two women, one was 30 years old, and 
the other was about 20 years old. I first chose a pair of pants, blue or black, 
for more than 11 yuan, I&#39;m very satisfied. These pants are quite popular. After 
I bought it, she asked me to buy a coat. I just didn&#39;t allow it, so she forced 
me. I didn&#39;t know what it was like. I said I was grateful. It wasn&#39;t enough. She 
was my mother, so I knew it was maternal love. The salesperson picked one for 
me. It was too liberating. This pocket and that line were said to be suitable 
for young people. I didn&#39;t like it very much. My mother asked me to try it on, 
so I wore it. She said it was more elegant. I said no, so I picked again. At 
that time, I saw a light yellow coat, which was a suit style, and said yes. My 
mother thought it was acceptable to wear it, so she paid me 18 yuan. On the way, 
my mother said she would buy me a watch. I quickly said No. She knew the time at 
school. She said that my little uncle had a watch, but the case was broken. I 
didn&#39;t say anything. She said that my sweater was well knit. It was cute and 
thick. I said I would go back on the national day. When I got to the dormitory 
for a while, she left. I took her to the station. After I bought a ticket at the 
station, I left. As soon as I went out, she caught up with me and told me to 
study hard and pay attention to my health. I promised one by one and left.<br>
<br>
My mother came with thirty yuan and love for me. My mother left with clothes and 
love for my son. What can I give my mother? Thank you? Nonsense! She is my 
mother. Do you repay her? Yes, what will you do in return? Grow up and make 
money? Of course it is necessary, but it is too tacky. Can the love between 
mother and son be measured by money? So I thought of learning, right! Study 
well, start a career, become a family, honor our ancestors, and make people know 
my family and my mother. Mother, do you know?<br>

Today, I was wearing new clothes, so sun Guanghai said; &quot;Straight&quot;, long 
Xuezhong grabbed me and looked at it for a while. Lihongtao said, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
you. I can only tell when you call me.&quot; taichenghua said, &quot;I&#39;ve gone on a blind 
date.&quot; Wang Feng said, &quot;it&#39;s nothing to say when I see my suit.&quot; so I thought of 
crying. You know, it&#39;s the sweat of my parents. I felt like a real man when I 
wore it. One morning, my good friend didn&#39;t come. I was very disappointed. How I 
wanted her to know. When I saw her in the afternoon, she wasn&#39;t surprised. As 
usual, she didn&#39;t even look at it, let alone appreciate it. I suffered a great 
injustice. Alas, how can I become vulgar? What about my study? What about my 
career? I was shocked by my ancient prose, Tang poetry and Song poetry, and 
almost went wrong. &quot;You should learn more.&quot; I don&#39;t know who was shocked, so I 
woke up, found the ancient poetry, and smiled happily.<br>

&quot;really?&quot; I told him yes, so I had dinner with him. When I got to the cinema, 
there was a rush. I bought two tickets and a dime more for melon seeds, so I 
started watching the movie. It was the story of transporting tigers made in the 
Soviet Union. It was very interesting, and we laughed. Later, I found that the 
movie was not good. Although Chen Bin had been laughing, I lost my smile. After 
watching it, I went back to the classroom and just had class.<br>

first time in fact&quot; (I went there once in the afternoon). I also said, &quot;I&#39;ve 
just been here.&quot; when I thought about it, I said, &quot;he said he&#39;d seen it for the 
first time.&quot; XURUI nodded and I said, &quot;it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen you.&quot; XURUI

Today, the school included the film &quot;catch the enemy at the bottom of the sea&quot; 
and the film &quot;comrades, you should be vigilant&quot;. After watching it, I was very 
surprised that there are so many enemy agents in the motherland that doesn&#39;t 
want peace. I also deplored that some Chinese are acting as agents and providing 
intelligence for foreign countries (the Soviet Union) on Chinese soil. Are they 
just for money? I don&#39;t know. I admire the public security soldiers, the

After lunch, I went to the door of the experimental building. Zhaojiankang 
invited me upstairs to eat. I didn&#39;t want to. Then Xiong Wenbin pulled me. I 
went up with them. After a meal, Wang Feng came up and talked back about me. 
Wang Feng said I couldn&#39;t sing. Xiong Wenbin also attached. Zhaojiankang said I 
was a publicity committee member. Wang Feng said, &quot;is he still a publicity 
committee member?&quot; Xiongwenbin said, &quot;not necessarily. As long as you can 
organize, you don&#39;t have to be able to sing.&quot; Wang Feng said, &quot;he can&#39;t be a 
publicity committee member. I directly look down upon him.&quot; The words were so 
incisive that I said, &quot;are you a publicity committee member? If you are not, 
don&#39;t satirize others.&quot; It suddenly occurred to me to punish him, so I said, 
&quot;are you a cadre? You must not be. I directly despise you.&quot; He was speechless, 
because I was a cadre (study committee member). I think this is to treat people 
in their own way. In spite of this, I also thought of Chen Bin. He aroused my 
enthusiasm for singing. He sang with me every day, especially in the next 
night&#39;s self-study. He sang with me back to the dormitory. I call this our happy 
hour. Chen Bin, how I want to sing with you.<br>

This afternoon, the school started the National Day holiday for three days. I am 
going to go back tomorrow because I have something to do. When we went to the 
gymnasium with biqingyuan in the evening, the streets were ablaze with lights, 
sometimes colorful lights, sometimes huge lanterns, and sometimes large slogans 
came into our eyes. All of a sudden, the world seemed to be much more spacious, 
making people forget the night. I went to the gymnasium, but I didn&#39;t have 
tickets. I was not allowed to enter. After wandering for a while, I suddenly met 
Qin bin. He also had no tickets, so biqingyuan left. Qin bin and I didn&#39;t get in 
after several times. After a while, we said that we would get in if there were 
tickets, so we got in several people with tickets. After a while, a middle-aged 
woman called a police officer and said, &quot;Xiao Zhang, these two are from the 
factory.&quot; so two women emerged. The police put them in. We knew they had no 
tickets. At this time, another woman wanted to enter, so the police stopped her 
to ask for a ticket. The woman said that the man behind her called in (the 
middle-aged woman with magical powers), so the police asked, &quot;who called you?&quot; 
It turned out that they had not forgotten that they were two, so the woman was 
stopped outside the door. Soon another policeman and a woman went in with a 
child in their arms, and there was no ticket. People pushed forward as usual, 
and the child&#39;s shoes were on the ground, so the policeman was extremely vicious 
(was it too much?) He pushed the child in front with his arms. People pushed 
forward again, and the police still stopped to ask for tickets. At this time, 
Qin bin suddenly said, &quot;do those people have tickets?&quot; A policeman said: &quot;who, 
you can drag.&quot; &quot;OK, I know him.&quot; so Qin bin pushed towards the door. At this 
time, another policeman suddenly pushed Qin bin. Qin bin fell down, his feet 
stopped at the door, and people fell into the field. The policeman shouted in a 
low voice: &quot;look at you squeezing.&quot;. So I went up to Qin bin and blamed him for 
not doing it (in fact, I was full of peifo, and I wanted to do it too), so we 
left. Qin Bin said, &quot;I have to go to a public security school when I grow up. I 
will take care of them in the future.&quot;. We entered the trade union, played ball 
games and broke up. I watched TV at school. On the way, I suddenly felt that the 
light was brighter.<br>

Get up early in the morning and get up. XURUI shouted outside the door, so I 
went to the station with him and bought tickets to go home. When I got home, my 
brother asked and I promised. Later, grandma came out of the room and saw her 
father cooking breakfast. Later, her mother also got up. My father met me and 
said that the clothes were very good. After a while, he began to eat a few pots 
of pancakes. Later, they told me that the timber had been sold to my aunt&#39;s 
house, so I felt that I had failed. At first, I guessed that Taiwan had paid or 
sold pigs. Now I know that it was the money to sell timber. During the summer 
vacation, I said that I would sell timber. That would be a little money. Now I 
really sold it, &quot;the mountains and rivers are exhausted&quot;, I think. The wood is 
going to make furniture for us. Of course, I don&#39;t want furniture, but it&#39;s the 
great intention of my parents. I can&#39;t do it myself.<br>

Today is the national day. After listening to the &quot;military parade and Mass 
Parade&quot; on the radio in the morning, I didn&#39;t realize that I was new. As soon as 
I was excited, I was intoxicated and dissolved in it. In the evening, after 
watching the TV &quot;fireworks party&quot;, &quot;military parade&quot; and &quot;Mass Parade&quot;, it was 
even more refreshing. The fireworks broke up one after another for a long time. 
The reviewed troops were very powerful and neat. The farmers around said, &quot;they 
are the same as the gaiwa&quot; (referring to the big felt hat), and one said, &quot;they 
are even better than the wa.&quot; When Deng Xiaoping reviewed the troops, he said, 
&quot;Hello, comrades!&quot; &quot;Hard work, comrades!&quot; The soldiers shouted in unison, 
&quot;Hello, chief!&quot; &quot;Serve the people!&quot; It can shake the world. During the mass 
parade, the first team even issued a slogan: &quot;Hello, Xiaoping&quot;. In short, this 
is the first time I have watched it on TV, and it is unforgettable. I am a 
citizen of the people&#39;s Republic of China, so I am proud.<br>

After lunch, I went to my uncle&#39;s house with my mother and got a watch at his 
house. My mother-in-law said that she would control the time for me. He also 
blamed my family for not selling wood and said that he could go to her house to 
borrow money. Mother told her not to, because she borrowed a lot, her family 
also wanted money to build buildings. I am very grateful. I just hope I will 
grow up soon.<br>

After lunch, Chen Bin asked me to go to the classroom. I suddenly remembered 
that biqingyuan had a new badminton racket, so Chen Bin and I borrowed it from 
biqingyuan. The racket belonged to Wang Fei, so we played it for a while. We 
were not used to it. Of course, it was still hot. After a while, Wang Fei came 
and asked for a racket. Chen Bin said, &quot;I didn&#39;t take it.&quot; &quot;Puppy take&quot;. I said 
nothing because I took it. He said to Chen Bin, &quot;I&#39;ve been through it for you.&quot; 
When he went to XURUI&#39;s place to drink boiled water, he poured a lot of water to 
others and talked about it for a while. Chen Bin just praised XURUI&#39;s dormitory 
for its good conditions. After drinking the water, he felt warmer and went to 
the classroom.<br>

After dinner in the morning, they went to eat with Chen Bin. After a while, 
sunguanghai came and talked about it. At this time, an old man poked his head 
out of the room and went in again. So sunguanghai asked me if I still remember 
the last time? I said I remember. The old man was very slippery. Maybe the old 
man heard something and went out and said, &quot;what are you laughing at?&quot; I said, 
&quot;I&#39;m talking about you,&quot; he said, &quot;I have a son. What can I talk about? I 
graduated from high school and didn&#39;t have a diploma. In the electromechanical 
Bureau, I rely on backstage hard work.&quot; I listened inexplicably and agreed: &quot;the 
backstage is the trump card, and the diploma is only the silver medal.&quot; He said: 
&quot;no diploma is not enough, only thanks to the backstage hard.&quot; Sun Guanghai 
asked him how many sons he had. He said, &quot;I have more sons, and I have four.&quot; So 
we all suddenly understood that we laughed, causing many diners to laugh. In the 
laughter, he was bored and left. After a while, I explained: &quot;he said there were 
many sons, maybe seven or eight. He gave birth to four. Then the others were not 
born to him, but to others.&quot; So even the people who understood earlier laughed 
with the people who just understood. Of course, sunguanghai and Chen Bin laughed 
the most. The old man was too thoughtless to speak, and I caught him laughing.<br>

In the third class this afternoon, our class held its first cultural and 
recreational activity. After we sat down in the class, Hong Xin, the Secretary 
of the League branch, went to the podium and said that the cultural and 
recreational committee would preside over it. Then, the cultural and 
recreational committee went up and said, &quot;this is the first time. After the 
history exam, you should relax.&quot; That&#39;s very impressive. Jiminjue asked her to 
sing, and she was very willing to sing &quot;dry wine sells nothing&quot;, which was very 
pleasant to listen to, so we applauded warmly. Later, the League branch 
secretary sang two songs, which were OK. Chen Bin and Qin bin sang a chorus. 
Finally, the League branch secretary said, &quot;please have a study committee 
member.&quot; I was shocked. I didn&#39;t know what it was like. I argued in the 
applause. Of course, no one could hear me. I asked my colleague biqingyuan to go 
up. Biqingyuan refused, so I got settled, and then I left. How I want to sing, 
but what about my voice?<br>

In today&#39;s composition class, teacher Fei read two compositions written in grade 
one of senior high school, I feel the beauty of my hometown when I return home. 
They are very good. They are characterized by the quotation of ancient poems, 
the good sentences in Wang Bo&#39;s preface to King Teng&#39;s pavilion, and 
TaoYuanming&#39;s good sentences. After reading them, the teacher asked us to study 
and read more classics. At this time, I found that there were still students 
reading these. I remembered my ancient prose, Tang poetry, Song Ci, and made a 
secret determination. During the break, the teacher talked to some of our 
writing group classmates. He said that after evaluation, he decided to send my 
&quot;a paradise&quot; and guanwenfeng&#39;s &quot;talking about the county before the National 
Day&quot; and an article by Liu Hui to the newspaper, but it was delayed. I felt a 
burst of pride. The teacher said that my article was obviously fictitious, but 
the idea was novel and rough. I acquiesced, but I was not discouraged. I would 
like to thank teacher Fei for overcoming it in the future. After that, I decided 
to run a tabloid newspaper. I was very proud.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I saw a film, the Soviet Union&#39;s &quot;red sail&quot;, which was very 
good, especially the prince&#39;s words: &quot;miracles are created by ourselves.&quot; I 
really appreciate it. I came back to watch &quot;female slaves&quot; on TV.<br>

I played badminton all afternoon this afternoon. From 11:30 to 5:30, my feet 
were extremely sour. As long as I drank water, my feet would not sweat. But I 
was very satisfied with playing badminton so happily for the first time.<br>

At noon today, I washed my clothes. Somehow, during this period, I was very 
afraid of washing my clothes. I haven&#39;t washed my pants for a week. What&#39;s more, 
I didn&#39;t wash a pair of socks. Later, a pair of socks got dirtier, so I had to 
put on the dirty socks to be washed again. After a while, the clothes were 
washed, and I relaxed a lot. It turns out that it is not difficult to do 
anything by yourself, but we must do it.<br>
<br>
Tonight, I filled in the date of birth on my study card. I remembered that I was 
born in 1969 after the new year&#39;s day in 1969, but not after the Spring Festival 
(December 14). I should have been born in 1969 (according to the Gregorian 
calendar). But I used to be born in 1968 according to the lunar calendar, so I 
changed my mind. In this way, I was one year younger, becoming 16 years old (for 
monkeys, nominal years old) and 17 years old for monkeys. I went to school at 
the age of seven. Grandma told me that the day I was born was the coldest day of 
the year. It was twelve degrees below zero. Before going to bed, grandma 
thought, &quot;don&#39;t give birth tonight,&quot; but later my father went to call her. &quot;Born 
at the coldest time of the year,&quot; I will always remember.<br>

This afternoon, the school packed the movie Li Bing. My ticket was very good. 
No. 2, row 2, upstairs. Of course, my mood was higher when I watched the movie. 
The film is very successful, especially the lines are very good: &quot;in an 
extraordinary place, in an extraordinary time, you need an extraordinary 
person.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not difficult to be an official. It&#39;s difficult to be an 
official. He can&#39;t be an official. He can only do things.&quot; &quot;Where is the wife? 
Where is the son?&quot;<br>

In the afternoon self-study class, Secretary Yao suddenly came to our class. He 
announced that our class would offer science and chemistry courses. Then he 
analyzed the benefits of learning to us. Finally, he said that I would not take 
the college entrance examination. I was relieved. To be honest, I still wanted 
to learn. After that, we applauded warmly. He motioned not to, and left.<br>

This afternoon, we went to the workers&#39; Cultural Palace to see the changes of 
Jurong on the 35th anniversary of the national day. When I arrived at the trade 
union, I waited for a while because there was a visitor inside. After reading 
the messages, some of them belong to Taiwan. They say that they are moved by the 
changes in Jurong across the country. After a while, I went to the third floor 
to see photography and calligraphy. The calligraphy is very good, including 
cursive, running and regular script. Because I don&#39;t know much about it, I can&#39;t 
say any good comments. I just praise it. Some of them are poems of the Tang 
Dynasty, such as &quot;leaving the ancient Grassland&quot; (Bai Juyi), or words of 
Chairman Mao, or &quot;rejuvenating China&quot;. There is also a poem written by the 
author himself. Unfortunately, it is impossible to write down without a pen. It 
is about change. There are two clay sculptures: &quot;Nu&quot; and &quot;Wang&quot;, which are the 
faces of a young man. I looked at them closely, but I didn&#39;t see them well, 
because they were not alive. There are also several traditional Chinese 
paintings. I know that I have poor appreciation ability and do not know right or 
wrong. Those photos are fascinating. There are National Day fireworks and dragon 
dances, especially the pictures of rural life. There are professional 
households, some are raising fish, some are raising chickens and geese, and a 
centenarian combs her granddaughter&#39;s hair. There are Maoshan mountain going 
into the forest. I don&#39;t feel my world is shallow and my hometown is backward. 
Then I went downstairs to have a look.<br>
<br>
A male commentator led us to the Jurong map. He said that Jurong looks like a 
bear (a very elephant), with a bear head in the north, two bear feet in the West 
and a tail in the south. Jurong has a history of about 2000 years since Emperor 
Wu of the Han Dynasty, and has discovered cultural relics 5000 years ago, with a 
population of 560000. He also said: &quot;you live in this land and strive for its 
better construction.&quot; With our tacit consent, we visited the forest, poultry, 
industry and other projects under the guidance of commentators. Jurong dump 
trucks were exported to foreign countries. Clothing from garment factories 
entered the markets of Japan and the United States. Badminton is also popular in 
Denmark, Britain and other countries. It is a ball for international 
competitions. We can&#39;t help feeling proud. Looking at the beautiful scenes, I 
just think it has nothing to do with me. But when I saw the teaching building in 
Jurong County, I changed my mind. The original place where people live day and 
night is also so beautiful, but I didn&#39;t find it, or it&#39;s in the picture. It&#39;s 
&quot;it&#39;s difficult to live up to the reputation&quot;. We didn&#39;t leave for a long time.<br>

At noon, I went to play basketball with biqingyuan. After playing for a while on 
the basketball court of the school of advanced studies, Wang Qun suddenly went 
to school by bike. I don&#39;t know if he saw me (I consciously didn&#39;t). She got out 
of the car, gave it to someone else, and went to school. I was confused for a 
while, and I really hoped that she could see it. But after a long time, I didn&#39;t 
see her, and it rained a little. After playing for a while, I went to our middle 
school to play. What a disappointment. After school in the afternoon, I played 
ball with Tang Bing (Chairman of the student union), a senior three student in 
senior high school. His skills were similar to mine, and he was also very 
suitable. I played many good balls, even I was surprised. After playing for a 
long time, Wang Fei came. He took out his new ball and played for a while. He 
wanted to replace me. Can I? At this time, the women&#39;s volleyball team came to 
play, and I hoped Xu Qian could see me. Maybe it was that way (sure). I played 
very hard. Later, Tang Bing said he would not play, so I went to play.<br>

At noon, when several of us handed in the photos, Ji minjue suddenly laughed. 
After a while, fengqingrong said that he saw my appearance (I don&#39;t know whether 
it was the drawing line or... I hope the former), but they were all ghosts and 
ugly. Am I right? I don&#39;t know, man, although I don&#39;t know how I am, I don&#39;t 
know in the mirror, even in the photos. I can&#39;t help but be surprised.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I took a bath with Tai Chenghua and had a self-study meeting. 
Suddenly, there was a power failure in the building, so I went to watch the TV 
&quot;old no new biography&quot;, which made us laugh. Tai Chenghua&#39;s smile is also very 
funny. When I went to bed at night, the whole dormitory said (ridiculed) that Da 
Hongwei was very good, but I had no intention to argue about it, and was silent.<br>

I got up very late this morning (because I slept late yesterday) and didn&#39;t have 
breakfast (the next Sunday). I looked in the mirror alone in the dormitory. 
After a while, the voice of a middle-aged man and a girl came to my ears. After 
listening carefully, I knew it was looking for someone. They were distinguishing 
by the sheets on the bed. The girl was also smart. After a while, she found 
something. That&#39;s it. The middle-aged man saw me and asked, &quot;where&#39;s Chen Bin?&quot; 
I told him that it was Chen Bin&#39;s bed and said, &quot;he is in class. I&#39;ll call him.&quot; 
I glanced at the girl earlier. The girl&#39;s figure was OK. She seemed to have a 
hazy beauty. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t see it clearly. I hurried to call Chen Bin. 
When Chen Bin came, I went to my own bed. After a while, they left and asked if 
Chen Bin was his sister. Chen Bin said yes. I suddenly found myself short of 
something. It turned out that I was short of a sister.<br>

This morning, I got up late. After doing exercises, I went to fetch rice. I 
didn&#39;t call Chen Bin (he was in class) as usual. When I went to the canteen, the 
line was long. I had to line up and move forward slowly. When it was my turn to 
call, Chen bin suddenly called me and gave me a two liang meal ticket and a two 
Fen vegetable ticket. Knowing that I was making steamed bread for him as usual, 
I was not allowed to say &quot;I have&quot;, but he left. Am I really going to do it for 
him? I have four liang of meal tickets in my hand. They are my twos and twos. I 
give Chen Bin two steamed buns and eat three or two by myself. I don&#39;t realize 
that I&#39;m a little sorry for my friend.<br>
<br>
After school in the afternoon, I played badminton. Mr. Ji patted me and said it 
was a small matter. It turned out that he wanted me to carry rice for him. In 
fact, it was very far from his dormitory to the canteen. The rice was heavy, but 
I had to recite it. However, I was very satisfied. He told me that if my 
achievements can be maintained now, there will be hope in the future and I can 
focus on them. I am hopeful. I must strive for my own goals. The future is long. 
What I need now is to strive for my goals (Chinese, literature, news).<br>

After school in the afternoon, we went to the new experimental building with 
biqingyuan. The building has three floors, which is divided into two from the 
gate. To the East is the experimental building. From the first floor to the 
third floor are the chemical laboratory, the physical laboratory and the 
biological laboratory, with three offices on each side. The first room in the 
west is the meeting place, the second floor is the library, and the third floor 
is the reading room. There are two teachers sorting it out. There are a lot of 
books in it. It&#39;s not too much to be full of sweat, is it? Several other 
students are busy. Then I went to play badminton with biqingyuan. I thought that 
after the opening, I would seriously go there to read books and play badminton. 
I went to have my hair cut. I heard that the old man in the bathhouse did a good 
job, so I went there. It happened that no one was there. The old master was 
eating bread. He asked me why? When I said to have my hair cut, he asked me to 
sit down and eat my own bread. I looked in the mirror and saw that my hair was 
long, but I was very impressed (it was good, but I didn&#39;t feel happy). I 
suddenly wanted to ignore it, but I thought I shouldn&#39;t have long hair, so I cut 
it.<br>

This afternoon, the school held a school meeting. Secretary Yao gave a speech 
entitled &quot;completely negating the Cultural Revolution&quot;. His speech was divided 
into two parts. First, he talked about what the Cultural Revolution was like and 
its harm. &quot;It was a catastrophe that was mistakenly launched by leaders (Mao 
Zedong) and used by two counter revolutionary groups, LinBiao and Jiangqing, and 
caused great losses to the party, the country and the people.&quot; he also gave an 
example of eating from a large pot. I am very familiar with it, When the 
production team goes to work, men get 10 points a day, women get 8 points, and 
just 6 or 7 points. Then he talked about the changes in the motherland after the 
smashing of the gang of four. He also talked about the expansion of our school. 
He said that one month after Chairman Mao Zedong died, the gang of four was 
smashed, but what if Chairman Mao died? Unimaginable, man?<br>

In the morning, I got the first (81 points) in the geography examination paper. 
In fact, the paper is not difficult. I can get more than 90 points. However, the 
examination was sudden because I didn&#39;t review. However, I am still satisfied. 
This is an encouragement to me.<br>

In the afternoon, we went to the Xinhua bookstore with biqingyuan. When we came 
to the school gate, we suddenly saw the first issue of stream sponsored by our 
writing interest group posted on the bulletin board. The inscription was written 
by President Wang, and teacher fan wrote the first words of the issue. On three 
sides, there were several articles, &quot;golden deer&quot; was right beside us (Liu Hui), 
and &quot;you feel the beauty of your hometown when you return home&quot; (a senior high 
school student). Suddenly, I saw my article, &quot;a story of a peach garden outside 
the world&quot;, which was inspiring, Suddenly I felt a little drunk and full of 
pride, but there was no my name on it (somehow), but anyway, it was my article! 
Biqingyuan and I went to the bookstore. I bought the book 300 poems of song, 
yuan and Ming Dynasty, which was compiled by the Qing people. I decided to 
memorize it. When I returned to school, I specially went to see the stream and 
silently read my peach garden.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to Mr. Ji&#39;s dormitory with Li Erqiao to see biqingyuan 
carving steel plates. Mr. Ji told me that as long as I worked hard, I would be 
able to enter the University. He said that I had a good foundation in English 
and mathematics, and I did well in history and geography this time. Li Erqiao 
said that I was going to take the exam in Nanjing University, and biqingyuan 
said that I was going to take the exam in Fudan. I thought I was going to do 
this, but......<br>

In the morning, when I walked out of the classroom and saw Wang Feng on the 
railing, I came forward and patted him. He was shocked. He was about to attack. 
When he saw me, he said, &quot;it scared me to death.&quot;. At the second break, I also 
leaned on the railing. He came out of the classroom door to me. I saw him and 
greeted him. He said he should scare me. I said he didn&#39;t. At noon, we played 
ball in class. In the afternoon, I said that the ball was broken. He joked that 
he would accompany me. I said that you wanted me to take the ball. Then I would 
find an excuse to accompany you. He said: &quot;how do you think of me as such a 
person, let alone a ball, is...&quot; I asked him something. He thought for a while 
and said, &quot;even my head won&#39;t do it.&quot; It&#39;s true. I&#39;m very glad that our 
relationship is good again. He really knows me, really.<br>

In the evening, after reading a novel in sprout, I suddenly understood

night, vulgar me.<br>

At noon, Li Hongtao said that he had a copy of ancient and modern legends there. 
I wanted to read it, and he agreed. In the afternoon, before class, I asked him 
for it. I didn&#39;t see him in class, so I went downstairs to the dormitory. I 
couldn&#39;t find it. I just found a book, thirty six strategies, and took it to 
read. After a while, Zhao Jiankang came to help me find it, but he couldn&#39;t find 
it. He said he was sorry for me, and I said I was sorry for him. I don&#39;t know 
who is really sorry. Before class, I was reading a Book (thirty six strategies). 
Suddenly, Li Hongtao smiled modestly and asked me if I could find him? I knew it 
was zhaojiankang who told him, so I said yes. Then I asked for the book. He 
couldn&#39;t find it for a while. After school, he brought it to me, and I began to 
read it. When I was reading the book in the evening, Li Hongtao came and asked 
me if I had any reference books on chemistry? I smiled and said, &quot;why do I take 
it at home? It&#39;s my brother&#39;s, and I&#39;ll bring it next week.&quot; he said that his 
chemistry score was not very good, so we talked for a while. He left, and I 
watched the Chinese and foreign legends again.<br>

Today is Sunday. I have been watching Chinese and foreign legends all morning. 
When Wang Feng came, he said that his watch would be repaired and played with 
for a while. He asked me to look at the watch. I gave it to him. He pulled off 
the strap and suddenly said, &quot;it&#39;s Zhongshan&#39;s,&quot; I nodded. It seemed that he 
suddenly found a mystery and said, &quot;I thought the gem flower was there.&quot; because 
my surface was Gem Flower, I laughed and he laughed. After a while, we had a 
friendly talk, and I relived the warmth of the past. At noon, I went back to the 
classroom to see my Chinese and foreign legends. After a while, Xu Qian came and 
wore a pair of crimson sweaters. I felt very uncomfortable. I can&#39;t deny it. 
However, I thought more than that. &quot;What is it?&quot; I think, but I can&#39;t help 
feeling sad. Maybe it&#39;s not a bad thing, but maybe it shouldn&#39;t be. So I think 
of the novel again. It&#39;s love and people, vulgar.<br>

Before I woke up this morning, as usual, it was like a kind of consciousness 
that forced me not to get up. I was not human, but God was not God. Anyway, 
something oppressed me. I was confused, but I was very clear. After I got up, I 
knew that I had been cheated. I regretted that I should not be cheated. After I 
got up, my mind was very bad. It seemed that I had a heavy burden to bear. I was 
not happy. I was afraid to go out during recess. I felt sad and had nothing to 
say to anyone. At noon, I went to the street to play with Tai Chenghua, but it 
didn&#39;t get better. I was still groaning and at a loss. It seemed that everything 
was indifferent, and everything didn&#39;t belong to me. Looking back on my carefree 
mood in the past, it was funny, and I had no intention of it any more. At this 
time, I just felt that I was the most sober, but I also felt that it was 
meaningless to be a human being. In fact, this has happened many times. 
Sometimes my mood is good, sometimes it is like this. How is this going on? 
There is no spiritual sustenance? I think.<br>

Today&#39;s mood is quite different from yesterday. I think everything is 
meaningful. It&#39;s normal. This afternoon, I did well in the history test. After 
passing the test, I blew it. Suddenly, wangxiaoping said that I should help 
clean up. I acquiesced and went to get a broom first. If it was bad, I went to 
class 2 to get one. The other two are girls. They clean from the east to the 
West. I do the opposite. I sweep the floor just like the sum of them. Later, 
Zhang Aiqin and yanhuiying went upstairs, probably to pick up a dustpan. Later, 
I also went upstairs. Sure enough, they cleaned the garbage.<br>
<br>
Today, I cleaned the blackboard. After wiping it off, I saw Li Erqiao and Chen 
Bin laughing. Chen Bin said that he was jealous. I was puzzled. Li Erqiao said 
that I twisted and did it when I went to the podium. I was surprised. How could 
I not know that Wang Fei and Feng Qingrong had said so before? What should I do? 
Change! I think. Every time I clean the blackboard, I get Xuqian&#39;s eyes. I don&#39;t 
want to be disappointed one by one. After dinner, I asked biqingyuan for some 
soap powder, washed my clothes, and washed beside the water. Xu Qian and her 
companions came to wash their hands. I was upset for a while, so I quickly 
poured out the dirty water in the basin. After one person fetched the water, her 
companions began to wash. After one person left here, I received the water, and 
then stepped aside. Xu Qian came to wash. I thought of what she said when she 
first came: &quot;Oh, so many people,&quot; Alas, do you know the human heart?<br>

At noon, biqingyuan took a copy of selected notes of Tang Poems (Volume I). 
Later, Li Erqiao took a copy of Volume II. I borrowed it. It was bought by 
biqingyuan. There were only 367 poems compiled according to 300 Tang poems. 
After reading it, I found it was not good, but I became more determined to 
recite the poems. After a while, when Li Erqiao read my thirty years (drunk), I 
said that he had read it to me. Drunk used to be the Commissioner of the 
Kuomintang Armed Forces Department in Yunnan and the head of the Yunnan Station 
of the military Statistics Bureau. He was forced to revolt by Lu Han, but he was 
also a prisoner of war. There are duyuming, Wang LINGJI, Huang Wei and xuyuanju 
(xupengfei) in the book. These are all special talents who later worked in 
literature and history. There are also Puyi and PuJie, who also wrote &quot;Dai Li I 
know&quot; and &quot;inside the Bureau of military statistics&quot;. After reading this book, I 
learned a little about the Kuomintang. In the book, Jiang Qing is a traitor and 
Zhang Chunqiao (Dick) is a spy of the Bureau of military statistics. It&#39;s not 
funny.<br>

Today, the school arranged a movie called Zorro the righteous hero. Just after 
watching the film, I suddenly heard the voice of &quot;no, this way&quot;. I saw an old 
man touching the aisle, but he touched it on the chair and said, &quot;I can&#39;t see 
it.&quot; As soon as I saw this, I went up to hold him and helped him go. He said, 
&quot;thank you.&quot; I asked him how many rows he had. He said one row. I helped him to 
the front and asked him the number. He said the fourteenth. When I saw that 
there was a vacant seat nearby, I decided to help him sit on the fourteenth. He 
said thank you, and I went back to my seat. &quot;How do I want to do this good 
thing?&quot; I asked myself, but in retrospect, I didn&#39;t think of anything at that 
time, just like I was supposed to do. This is nature! When I watched the movie, 
I didn&#39;t seem to feel comfortable. I had lingering palpitations. I didn&#39;t even 
have the heart to talk to biqingyuan. (subconsciously, show it to Xuqian.).<br>

After school this afternoon, I went to buy rat poison. I had to go back this 
week. I had prepared the fare originally, but the teacher had to pay for it, so 
I didn&#39;t have any money. Only my uncle asked me to buy rat poison for one yuan. 
I don&#39;t know where there was one (he wanted to buy it in the drugstore). I only 
saw one store to buy medicine. Because there were some people taking it for 
people, I was afraid I didn&#39;t buy it. I had to use the money this time. If I 
didn&#39;t buy the medicine, I would certainly not be able to pay the whole yuan 
when I paid back the money, It&#39;s hard to say. Besides, I can&#39;t live in the 
world. What about buying? It&#39;s hard to find a place to buy at the stall. I&#39;m 
sorry for my uncle. At this time, I thought, &quot;go to the drugstore and ask. If 
you have any, you&#39;d better buy at the stall. Go back and tell my uncle that 
because the drugstore doesn&#39;t have any money (fare), go back and take it out at 
home to make up for it.&quot; it was a good trick. I thought, I suddenly found that I 
was becoming smarter.<br>
<br>
On the drugstore Road, I suddenly saw Wang Qun at a corner. She and another 
person (first estimated the original class, but then didn&#39;t see it clearly) were 
coming face to face while eating big cakes. I didn&#39;t realize that my heart was 
talking about my voice, and my blood was frozen. The surface was very 
uncomfortable. My legs seemed very mechanical and ugly. It was only a few meters 
away, but it seemed very difficult to walk. I glanced at her and saw a smile, 
but she didn&#39;t seem to see me. Maybe it was intentional. I walked over to relax. 
Alas. What am I? Rare. Wang Qun, I am alone in the street. I went down to the 
drugstore. When I asked, I was very proud.<br>

Today Saturday, I was going to go home. After taking the bus, when I walked to 
the arch bridge, I suddenly found a man carrying a load of dung and turning 
eastward, looking very much like my father. He might have seen me too. After 
walking for a while, he stopped at my house. I dared to judge that it was my 
father and that there was another person, my mother. I went to them and called, 
and they naturally asked me. My father quietly told my mother that it was a new 
dress. I knew he said it was good for me to wear new clothes.<br>
<br>
After a while, my father said he would buy me a watch. I said it was 
unnecessary. There was not much benefit in wearing a watch. He said he really 
bought it. After a while, he asked me to go back. When I got home, a man called 
&quot;who knows?&quot; it was grandma. After a while, she had left the lower room. I 
called. After a while, she called me to the stove and filled me with chicken. 
Then she whispered, &quot;Taiwan has money again, which is worth more than 260 yuan 
(onehundred dollars). The letter hasn&#39;t come yet.&quot; So I thought of my father&#39;s 
words. After a big meal in the evening, my grandmother asked me if I had taken 
the geography test. I said I had taken the geography test once, and my parents 
asked me how many points. I said 81. They were stunned, but I was waiting for 
them to ask. As expected, I asked the highest number. I said it was so much. 
Obviously, their hearts fell down, and I was not without pride.<br>

In the afternoon, my mother saw me on the bus. On the way, suddenly a bicycle 
passed by. My mother also scolded me. When I saw that it was Zhang yingzi from 
Murakami, I shouted &quot;aunt&quot;. She also got off the bus. My mother carried rice for 
me, so she put the rice on her cushion and let her take it along with the way. 
She said, &quot;send your son to the end.&quot; her mother said there were many things at 
home, so she left. When I got to school, I could have dinner, but I had to buy a 
handout folder. The price was 2.49 yuan. There were two purposes. One was to 
need a handout folder. When he asked me what color it was, I asked for a blue 
one. (Xu Qian had a blue one). Of course, I was very happy after buying it.<br>

At noon, when I weighed the rice, Xiong Wenbin said that he didn&#39;t have 20 jin. 
I blurted out, &quot;I didn&#39;t kill him.&quot; Xiong Wenbin stretched out his tongue. I 
also knew that I lost my mouth. But the man who weighed the rice didn&#39;t say 
anything. Am I the one who said that? In the afternoon, I took the meal ticket. 
I had just taken the food ticket and had to leave. Because class was over, Lu 
tou said that there was still a meal ticket. Then I knew. The person who sold 
the meal ticket said that he had forgotten. I smiled. It was careless. There are 
few here.<br>
<br>
During the class meeting, Mr. Ji gave me a list of newspapers and periodicals 
and asked me to contact Mr. Yang (who is in charge of books). I didn&#39;t know what 
to contact and didn&#39;t know Mr. Yang very well. Li Erqiao said that she knew him. 
It was a coincidence that she was talking to people in front of the experimental 
building. I went to her. She led me upstairs and handed me a form to fill in. 
She asked me my name. I said &quot;Ge Yimin&quot; first. She wrote a Ge, and I pressed &quot;Ye 
Min&quot;. But she carried the word Ge and changed it to &quot;Ye Min&quot;. I was amused. She 
also called me &quot;Ye Min&quot;. I didn&#39;t want to argue with her because it didn&#39;t 
matter. Later, I wrote my real name, but she was confused when she shouted. I 
could fill in the form and left.<br>

In the afternoon, teacher Fei came to me and asked me whether I had written an 
article recently. I said no, he said that he would set up an editorial committee 
of four or five people, and decided to have me. Of course, I would be very 
happy.<br>
<br>
After a while, biqingyuan and I were reading the newspaper. Suddenly, we 
instinctively raised our heads. I knew that no one was talking to me at that 
time. When I saw zhengrenxiang saying, I asked something. She said when to pay 
the newspaper fee. I said, &quot;whatever.&quot; suddenly, I found Xuqian behind me, hands 
on my back. I was happy. Zhengrenxiang said something to his companions. Before 
he left, I didn&#39;t know where he was clever. They were naturally happy when I 
gave her the simple watch. I especially noticed that Xu Qian was very proud to 
look through it. I was very satisfied. Today, the school bought atropine eye 
medicine for 4 yuan to cure our myopia. Of course, I was happy. I dropped two 
drops at night. It was very good.<br>

Today, the whole school is working to pick up stones on the playground. After 
picking up my meal, I met Wang Fei on the way. Before we ate in the dormitory, 
he stopped to eat. After a while, Diao Dao brought a bowl. Wang Fei said, &quot;we 
still have a few steps to the dormitory, but we&#39;d better wait for you.&quot; I said, 
&quot;what a good friend,&quot; cheating? After a while, Wang Fei said that spinach was 
not hollow. He used to eat very thin. I said it was an allotrope. Diao Daosheng 
praised it. I was very proud. In the evening self-study, Diao Daosheng said that 
I was Diao. I believed Diao. I said I was joking. I really wanted to laugh at 
Diao Daosheng&#39;s seriousness.<br>

In the morning, I was reading the newspaper. Because the next class was physical 
education, many students went to play ball. After a while, I couldn&#39;t figure out 
how I knew it. Anyway, she looked up. Xu Qian stood at the table, hands free and 
easy in her coat pockets, and whether her body was shaking. She said that she 
would order middle school students&#39; English and, I listened and remembered that 
when she kept talking, I glanced at her carefully and saw her smiling. I was 
very proud. Later, I said that my companion had ordered And &quot;middle school 
students&#39; English&quot;, then return to your seat. After a while, I turned around and 
said (Shanghai). I promised &quot;Oh&quot;, which seemed very high. I asked how long it 
would take. She said one year, and one partner said &quot;one year&quot;. She said, &quot;just 
one year if you want to order it&quot;. I appreciated it very much. Later, she 
ordered it for another partner. I was surprised. But satisfied.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I flew to the library with Wang Fei. This was the first time I 
moved from the library to the new building to read. After a while, Li Erqiao 
came. We went in and looked at magazines, such as historical research, 
literature, Chinese front, prose and poetry. I decided to read them every day. 
Later, I read the newspapers, first the Chinese Pinyin tabloid, and actually 
read the spring (Zhu Ziqing) and romantic song (Ji Yu), and then the Chinese 
newspaper. After a while, the time passed. It was really disappointing. Go again 
tomorrow, I think! He made up his mind.<br>

Today, I read &quot;the appointment of factory director Qiao&quot; carefully. Yesterday, 
teacher Fei said that the author jiangzilong had foresight and foresaw the 
future reform, so a large number of reformers emerged and won the honor. Today, 
after reading it, I felt that there was no taste. After reading it, it seemed 
that there was still something. I was at a loss. Alas! It turns out that reading 
such works for a long time is not enough. Only the first time can it be done. Is 
such an article highly respected? What kind of articles should I write? I don&#39;t 
know.<br>
<br>
At the grade meeting in the afternoon, President Wang made a speech, saying that 
we should pay attention to learning and have better learning methods. After the 
meeting, Mr. Ji came to me and asked who could speak in the evening self-study 
class. I was stunned. I wanted to say and then said Chen Bin. He also asked who 
was there. I said who was on that side. He said I had prestige in the class. Oh, 
did I help Chen Bin? I think so. Later, he said that he ordered &quot;Chinese youth&quot; 
in his class. He said that he would take the money here, and the class fee was 
five yuan. It was funny that he said that money was money.<br>

During the afternoon recess, zhengrenxiang said that Wang Xiaoping wanted to 
order a newspaper, so I registered. She said that she wanted to change her own 
newspaper. She said that she had ordered it at home. I promised. When I opened 
it, Xu Qian stood behind me as if looking at it. I did everything very quietly, 
but the words were bad. It was a great pity. Leng Buding said when she would pay 
the money. I dared to say &quot;it&#39;s up to you&quot;. It was the same sentence, but &quot;then&quot; 
was changed to &quot;you&quot; to warm up. In the morning, Mr. Zhangchunlin called me 
back. After seeing that he was waiting, I was uneasy on the stage, but instead I 
was uneasy. After all, I am half of them, but I am very satisfied.<br>
<br>
After school, I was reading a book. Tan Derong asked me if I belonged to the 
Dixing group. I dare say so. He asked me to make an instrument. I dragged 
biqingyuan to the third floor of the building. It turned out that it was a 
&quot;video game of China traffic map&quot;. The main railway lines and cities passed by 
were carved on a board. Each city pressed a light bulb to distinguish the 
answers. We did it for a while under the leadership of Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang asked 
me the time, (I don&#39;t know how I have a watch). I read it and told him that at 5 
o&#39;clock, he asked us to put it down and do it after school on Monday. After the 
evening self-study, I watched the TV play Xu Beihong.<br>

In the morning, I read the novel the reformer. I borrowed it because Fengmu had 
a high evaluation, but after reading it, I didn&#39;t see a good result. Maybe it 
was the reform. At noon, I went to the street with Wang Fei and bought a fluffy 
neck mask. Because the woolen sweater had no collar, I bought a purple one 
first. When I went to the dormitory, it didn&#39;t look good and unworthy. I really 
wanted to return it, but I thought it was impossible, so I prepared to change 
it. When I said that the man was willing, I said &quot;I&#39;m tired of you&quot;. She thanked 
me. I thought if I returned, it would always be a different look. In the 
morning, I came with my bowl and biqingyuan&#39;s in one hand. On the playground, I 
suddenly saw someone playing volleyball. I thought, &quot;don&#39;t upset the bowl&quot;. As I 
was walking, a ball flew in, the bowl fell to the ground, and the porridge 
overturned. I really didn&#39;t want to come over. The man dared to come over with 
me. I picked up the bowl and found him pounding his pocket. Knowing it was a 
meal ticket, I said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; and walked away, It was biqingyuan who 
overturned a bowl, but mine was good. Later, I cleaned the porridge. How I 
admire my handling method. Everyone is like this, I think.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I watched the &quot;China Japan Women&#39;s super Volleyball 
Championship&quot;. I watched the TV once in the second day of the junior high 
school. It was black and white. In zhuozhong, the county was colored this time. 
I was even more excited. I watched with Wang Ling. The Chinese team played very 
well, while the Japanese team only focused on smashing, and the defense was very 
poor. The Chinese team won 15:8 in the first set, 15:1 and 15:0 in the second 
and third sets respectively. At that time, I was also very excited. Someone on 
the Court played the slogan &quot;keep up the good work&quot;, There is also a &quot;Chinese 
women&#39;s volleyball fan club&quot;, which is exciting.<br>

I woke up very early in the morning. Because Tai Chenghua asked me to run, I 
didn&#39;t think of it. Two people got up later. Tai Chenghua also woke up and 
called me, so I answered and put on my clothes. It was only 5:35 when I ran. 
This time, I turned west from the school gate to the county Party committee, 
then to the gymnasium, then to the bus station, and then to the school. Such a 
big circle was much longer than before, but I insisted. At first, I didn&#39;t have 
any difficulty at all. Because I was running slowly, I felt very different from 
last time, so I made up my mind to run.<br>
<br>
In the morning, when Xu Qian paid the reimbursement fee, she said three things 
first. I said that there was no mistake, so I looked for it and found it. I was 
in a hurry to learn wisdom. Feng asked that the Tao changed, and said that I 
would take it. If there was, I would finish it. In the afternoon, Zheng handed 
it in again. Later, he looked for it. Later, he was reading it and said, &quot;wrong, 
four&quot;. He looked up to the sky and said that, therefore, if he didn&#39;t understand 
it, he should take his watch and read it. Later, Li Erqiao said, &quot;if you call 
me, I will lift you up.&quot; I actually knew that I was pretending not to do so. It 
was intended to use Chinese words, saying, &quot;Naying&quot;, and pointing fingers. I 
said it was not easy to call you a name. Of course, &quot;Hey&quot;, what did it mean? It 
was. He&#39;s just like me, I think. Somehow this morning, I linked him with 
lixiaoxia, a junior high school classmate. I felt that Li was very satisfied, 
but he was not. Li Wen was not in a hurry. He was far away. He thought a lot. It 
turned out that he was far away from my imagination. But this idea was when he 
was satisfied with me. Sad husband.<br>
<br>
Before the evening self-study, fengqingrong quarreled with Da Hongwei. Feng said 
that Da hit him for no reason. Then he ran away and told Mr. Ji that he had sent 
a telegram asking his father to come because he had been looking for trouble for 
many times. Ma Wen explained in detail that Yu Erqiao was full of words. I asked 
Li Erqiao. Li said, &quot;he said you are as good as anyone.&quot; Ma said that I was 
tricky and that Chen Bin agreed. I couldn&#39;t help laughing. Ma pointed out that I 
saw Da, and Chen Bin really knew me.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the library to find Mr. Yang to pay the newspaper 
fee. I didn&#39;t see him. I read the youth literature and history newspaper for a 
while and thought it was very good. Unfortunately, the library was closed for a 
while.<br>

When I woke up this morning, it was very dark (because of the heavy fog), but I 
got up and asked Tai Chenghua to run. Today, I didn&#39;t run as well as yesterday. 
After a while, my legs became sour. But I imagined that Tai Chenghua insisted on 
what he said yesterday. I could say that I insisted desperately. I also 
encouraged him with my self-control. Finally, I ran the same distance as 
yesterday, but later I didn&#39;t feel tired. In fact, we ran faster today than 
yesterday.<br>
<br>
Today, the head teacher asked the students, to be exact, the person who had been 
beaten by Da Hongwei to write the materials and the process. Yesterday, he sent 
a telegram to ask his father to come. Everyone wrote it, and it was true. But I 
also thought of the whole person writing black materials in the novel. That&#39;s 
the same. Whining, everyone is shining gold.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the library and asked Mr. Yang to pay the newspaper 
fee. I said 38 yuan first, but she checked 48 yuan. I was so careless. In the 
future, I will be so careless.<br>

This morning, Tai Chenghua woke up very late. After struggling in bed for a 
while, he stopped running because it was already 6 o&#39;clock and the day was very 
bright.<br>
<br>
Today, the school chartered a movie &quot;life&quot;, which I have already wanted to see. 
I think I should get something. The screenwriter of the film is Lu Yao. This is 
a novel. It has been on the radio for a while. It is a successful novel and a 
successful film. It&#39;s worth pondering after watching it. I don&#39;t think there are 
any mistakes in the film. GaoJiaLin is supposed to be a wild goose, while 
huangyaping is pursuing true love. Liuqiaozhen is also unable to marry Ma Shuan. 
Some people think that the reason is Kenan&#39;s mother. This is wrong. Although she 
is worthy of criticism, she did it because her son lost a good girl. Some people 
say that it was Ma Sheng, but he was just for his own interests, for the sake of 
the leadership, and to please the leadership. All kinds of people should not 
blame him. His existence is reasonable, and we should look for the reason from 
another thing, that is, the difference between urban and rural areas, that is, 
the low status of the bumpkin, trapped in those acres of land, &quot;I can&#39;t go to 
Suzhou, Hangzhou and Shanghai in my life.&quot; although the lives of farmers have 
improved in recent years, Isn&#39;t liuqiaozhen&#39;s family very rich? What&#39;s the use 
of marriage pomp? When there is no money, people need it. They can work hard for 
a little money. But when there is more money, it&#39;s not a good thing. Instead, 
they should pursue another thing, life! Cruelty.<br>

The difference between urban and rural areas exists and seems eternal. What

In the afternoon, I went to the library to pay the newspaper fee. When I saw 
several people there, she asked me to look through the magazines and wait a 
minute. I turned over a few books. After a while, Tang and a classmate came to 
study by themselves. They talked about yechao (former chairman of the student 
union of our university). He had good grades in the past, but Tang said that he 
had been admitted to Su University, was a technical secondary school, and 
graduated in two years. Both Mr. Yang and I were surprised. I thought he had 
been admitted to a good school. Only then did I know that the score was only 
three points higher than the admission line. He also reported to Tsinghua. Mr. 
Yang sighed and encouraged Mr. Tang. I also made a deep decision.<br>

I read early and was concentrating on Chinese. There was a noise outside the 
door. I knew that I was going to the hall. I was shocked. I went out and was 
promising. I shouted and left. My heart kept raising its voice. I was not 
ashamed to see Lu Yinhua. On the way, biqingyuan begged for steel because of his 
class. He didn&#39;t tease him. He knew him, but he had nothing to do. After 
arriving at the school, he asked if the big white shoes were not worn. After a 
while, he was very enthusiastic. He faked four yuan and gave it no more. He 
ordered a newspaper and sent it to the school gate. After arriving at the class, 
I saw Xu Qian and got angry. Alas, I really regret it. I can&#39;t help scolding 
myself. How Puqing I am. I also said that if I have no money for the exam in the 
future, I can&#39;t use more!<br>
<br>
Because I borrowed candles to read in class 2 last night, it was already bright 
when I woke up this morning. I knew it was late, but I still wanted to sleep. 
Maybe I didn&#39;t adapt to working late. After school at noon, I recited history 
carefully at the gate of the dormitory for the first time. I read it once and 
felt that I had learned a lot. If only I had grasped it before, I thought, 
suddenly, it was not too late. Yes, I grasped it.<br>

After school in the afternoon, I met Wang Feng at the entrance of the stairs. I 
left with Diao Daosheng. Wang Feng said: turn a blind eye to me. After listening 
to me for many times, I replied: I didn&#39;t hear of it. Oh, I don&#39;t know what I 
should turn a blind eye to.<br>
<br>
It seems that I am not in a good mood today, perhaps because I am about to take 
the exam, but in the final analysis, it turns out that I didn&#39;t read poetry.<br>

I got up very late this morning (Sunday). After waking up for a long time, I was 
reluctant to leave the quilt. After getting up reluctantly, when I had 
breakfast, it was gone. No, I have to go hungry. Yesterday, after self-study, I 
went to Mr. Wang&#39;s office in the experimental building to make a game map. He 
talked about life with us, saying that neither of them is worth sympathizing 
with nor learning. Gao knew that he had culture and should not be combined. Liu 
had no culture. I also think it&#39;s right to say that the farmers can&#39;t be the 
farmers in that way.<br>

In algebra class this morning, Miss Mei made a mistake in her homework, saying 
that only one person in the two classes did it right, and in our class (liberal 
arts class), I did it right, but I didn&#39;t feel anything. Later, it seemed that I 
had done the right thing. It sounded like my name, but I wasn&#39;t sure. At this 
time, I wondered whether the class could hear me and Xuqian clearly. Later, 
xuhuaibao, class 2, suddenly said that I could do it. I was baffled. Later, he 
said that I was the only one in the two classes. He asked me how I thought of 
it. I suddenly smiled, but felt satisfied. Class 2 must also know that Wang Qun? 
Later you Xuezhong said, of course I am happy. But I don&#39;t think how to learn by 
myself (because I&#39;m not interested in Mathematics), but I think that others 
know. Why?<br>
<br>
At noon, I saw Fujian youth. Suddenly, I benefited a lot. It gave me a new view 
on life and changed Xu Qian. I think it doesn&#39;t matter now. I can&#39;t think 
simply. I should do a good job in learning. In the future... Xu Qian was 
suddenly seen in the canteen. She suddenly felt that she had passed. Her 
appearance was almost different. It turned out to be talent and character. 
Whoops! Xuqianye, isn&#39;t it?<br>

The midterm exam will begin tomorrow. I suddenly feel that I haven&#39;t reviewed

In the morning, I took the Chinese test. I feel very sorry that I didn&#39;t write a 
word correctly. In the afternoon, I took the history test. After self-study in 
the evening, I read in the dormitory. After a while, Chen Bin and mawenxiang 
came in and said that history had been changed. I was the first in 93, and there 
were more than a dozen in 93 and 90. I was delighted for a while, but what else? 
Tacit, Li Erqiao got 82 points. He was unconvinced. I also want to assume that I 
have so many, how? It&#39;s really unthinkable. Whatever it is, it&#39;s better not to.<br>

Today, when I went upstairs, I suddenly met Xu Qian at the entrance of the 
stairs. Suddenly, it seemed that I met Xu Qian. I was in a hurry. I dared to go 
upstairs. But when I entered the classroom, I found that she was endorsing. I 
was surprised. I can&#39;t help blaming her, not only him, but myself. I didn&#39;t do 
well in the English test today, but politics is OK. I think &quot;I will focus on 
English in the future&quot;.<br>

After the geography test, my teacher and I got two questions right. It seemed 
like we got the right one. Suddenly, we asked and rubbed. We didn&#39;t speak. 
Later, we saw each other, but we gave it. It shouldn&#39;t be. We agreed after a 
while. It was embarrassing.<br>
<br>
When the exam was over, I went home. When I was waiting for the bus, two beggars 
came from time to time, and I gave them. Most of them didn&#39;t give them. I was 
very angry. It&#39;s strange that beggars always ask for money from me, calling me 
&quot;college student&quot; and &quot;the vicissitudes of the world are still there&quot;.<br>
<br>
When I got off the bus, I saw Mei Yuhua talking to a person in the same car. 
When I saw him, it was Gao Xianzhong. I was at a loss for a while. I wanted to 
stop before. I wanted to admit my incompetence. It seemed that I was shaking a 
few words. I thought the other party didn&#39;t know. I broke up in a hurry. It was 
not simple. I ran to avoid breaking up. He certainly didn&#39;t see me. I should pay 
to Mei: &quot;Gao Xianzhong didn&#39;t see it.&quot; he also said that he was the same, so I 
was very satisfied.<br>
<br>
On the way, I met Dai Qu and said that the Wu family in the village had built a 
building. Somehow, I underestimated him. I&#39;m not surprised. Sobbing.<br>

At the door of my house, I saw my mother sifting rice. She smiled and asked me

Today, I have to go to school again. At the right moment, my uncle went to the 
grain station, which saved me from carrying rice to the station. When I passed 
the village, I suddenly heard that the voice was my mother. I turned back and 
saw my mother. She said goodbye to me. My heart was warm. What a great maternal 
love.<br>
<br>
Today, I bought a watch strap (2.5 yuan) and watched the movie Shaolin boy, but 
it didn&#39;t look good. I, Li Erqiao and sunguanghai are very interested. Sometimes

in misfortune. But geography only has 80.5 points. I didn&#39;t feel cold. I thought 
it was the best one. There was no need to review.<br>

was very excited to go forward, and everyone rushed in a crowd. I saw it was 97. 
At that time, my pride overflowed. &quot;How many points, sir?&quot; &quot;Uncle 97&quot;, said Chen 
Bin. &quot;Yes, I did.&quot; I clapped my hands and went to clean the blackboard.

Today, I played badminton with biqingyuan at recess. After a while, Tan Derong 
also came to play badminton. In the afternoon, we went to Mr. Wang&#39;s place to 
play video games with biqingyuan. When we were studying in the evening, we 
suddenly saw a teacher behind us. He seemed to call me. I was stunned. He 
motioned with his hand. I saw that it was Mr. Fan. He must be looking for me. 
Then he went out. He asked me if I had more homework. I said no. actually, there 
were many. He asked me to look at the stream (sponsored by our Chinese interest 
group), and I agreed. Then I asked biqingyuan to go with me to correct two wrong 
words. Later, when it came to composition, he asked us to write. Biqingyuan and 
I were about to do this. Later, when he spoke, I couldn&#39;t help laughing. But I 
wanted to hold back. I didn&#39;t reach it, so I thought of all kinds of unpleasant 
things. When I thought of it, I really didn&#39;t laugh. He doesn&#39;t mind, but I 
always feel sorry for him. He asked me to write. I want to write two articles, 
one is &quot;mother&quot; and the other is &quot;the poor in the countryside only recognize 
money&quot;.<br>

Today, I wrote an article &quot;my mother&quot;, and suddenly felt that all my relatives 
should be written. There was also an article &quot;the rural poor know yellow gold 
and white silver better&quot;. When I conceived it, I thought it was very good. I 
thought it was great to make people happy, but later I didn&#39;t think it was good. 
It seemed that it was too ugly. Why?<br>

In the morning, when teacher Fei came to me at the break, he said, &quot;go and post 
the stream.&quot; I promised, so I went with him. When he passed class 1 of senior 
one, he went in to talk to a female classmate. I knew it was Liu Hui. She was 
not beautiful. She had met once before and even felt uncomfortable. But this 
time she was very close. Maybe it was her talent! I didn&#39;t feel happy for me. 
After posting stream, I found the words &quot;our editors Liu Hui, Ge Yimin, 
qianxiaoyu (art work)&quot;. I was very happy, but I really hope other students can 
know, Xu Qian?<br>

ZhangYangHao of Yuan Dynasty. He saw it while watching the meeting, and went to 
talk with zhengrenxiang. Xu Qian and hexianmei looked at the paper. Seeing Xu

physical and chemical group.&quot; I said to Mr. Chen: &quot;how can he call Mr. Su? 
Because Mr. Su is his woman, Chen Bin said,&quot; what is his name if he doesn&#39;t call 
Mr. Su? &quot; I think so.<br>

After school in the afternoon, we went to Mr. Wang&#39;s place to continue playing

so we started to do it. After that, it was 5:30. People had already gone to 
self-study, and it was dark. We hurried to get some food and went to the 
canteen. Fortunately, there were some food and vegetables, so we started to eat.<br>
<br>
It is of great benefit to continue reading resurrection.<br>

In the evening, I went to Miss Wang&#39;s office when I was studying by myself. I

Later, he said that he was angry because his pen was broken, so I forgave him.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to the street with biqingyuan. I wanted to buy a pair of leather 
shoes when the financial aid came down. I knew why. I was wrong. I didn&#39;t wear 
cloth shoes. I wanted to take them back,<br>

At noon today, I decided to wash the clothes. The clothes had been taken off for

At the same time, lvwendong also washed them, so I washed them together. After a 
while, I realized that everything was not difficult as long as it was done.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the school senior three men&#39;s volleyball team and the school 
women&#39;s volleyball team competed. Our school women&#39;s volleyball team won the 
&quot;Lei Feng Cup&quot; again in this year&#39;s urban competition. First, the women&#39;s 
volleyball team won two sets, and then the senior three won two sets, but the 
fifth set was not finished. It&#39;s a pity.<br>
<br>
After reading the resurrection today, I read it carefully. I spent a lot of time 
and benefited a lot. The &quot;Tolstoyism&quot; in the book actually shared some of my 
ideas. &quot;The land belongs to everyone as well as the sun and the air&quot; and 
&quot;forgive others seventy times and seven times&quot;. The title of the book 
&quot;Resurrection&quot; is that the hero nekhludoff finally saw the resurrection of the 
Gospels, that is, to eliminate the fog, and the heroine Maslova&#39;s resurrection 
felt human compassion and made his own sacrifice for it. The book contains a lot 
of social darkness, which is really a rare good novel.<br>

In the morning, after Xu Qian met her, she was new. She thought about what she 
had said last night. She said that Zhao Tingxi was greedy. She said that it was 
him. Chen Bin said that everyone saw him. Wang Ling said that he was talking 
about virtue and glory. So I told her that the specific people agreed with him. 
Then I would be superior to others, so my interest in him was greatly reduced. 
So I took out the ancient prose, and I was also resurrected. When I went to the 
reading room in the afternoon, I felt at ease and wanted to come every day. I 
just felt that the time was too short to be satisfied. I am a person who seeks 
all kinds of knowledge. I read every book and newspaper from beginning to end 
without missing a word. Therefore, I read magazines very slowly. I only read the 
history of middle school. The above knowledge is too rich. It highlights the 
knowledge in the books.<br>
<br>
In the evening, Li Erqiao asked me what I thought of Lu Xun&#39;s article. I said it 
was very good. He said it was the same. He said he didn&#39;t think it was. Now he

Today, it seems that all the students have gone back. Only a few students go to 
the evening self-study, which is rare. At noon, I went to Mr. Wang&#39;s office and 
put a paper on it. It was funny to see senior three students moving things, 
including records and Shajiabang. In fact, it was nothing. It was like hearing 
someone say Hua Guofeng was fallacious. It was incredible.<br>

After reading history in class this morning, I didn&#39;t want to lose it. The more 
I read it, the more interested I became. In the afternoon, while playing table 
tennis, I read some short ancient texts. I found that I was particularly 
interested in any book. After the evening self-study, Xu Rui found me, gave me 
clothes and vegetables, and gave me two yuan. He went back this week.<br>

someone at the window. Looking up, I saw my uncle talking with Wang Fei. So I 
went up, called and wanted to go with him. He asked me if I would tell the 
teacher. I said it was self-study, so I went with him. He said he had brought a 
quilt to change it. Later, like his father came last time, he still sent it from 
the back to the door. He stepped on the bus and left. Mr. Hou Mei asked if there 
were any classes? Why do I run around.<br>

This afternoon, the school held a group meeting for senior two and senior three. 
Mr. Jin sat down and just spoke, so there was a lot of applause. After a long 
time, he said again. There was another lot of applause. Everyone clapped and 
laughed. Then again, the teachers got angry and said they wanted to find out who 
it was. It was funny. Mr. Hou Ji sat next to me and told me that my grades were 
OK and that I would try to be the first next time. He said that if I scored 10 
points (83) more in English (73), I would catch up with zhengrenxiang. I was 
very proud, so I thought that other subjects were steady. English caught up with 
the first place and covered it geographically, so I felt much more relaxed.<br>

For the first time after school, I paid the League fee of 0.30 yuan (from 
September to February), and there were too few League activities. In addition to 
holding rare meetings, I paid the fee. After school, I went to have my hair cut 
with biqingyuan. Li Hongtao said it looked like a wig. Biqingyuan said it was 
long. Taoist priest and Wang Fei said the same. Li Erqiao said it was ugly. I 
usually have my hair cut once every two months, but biqingyuan said he had it 
cut twice a month. I really don&#39;t know. In the evening, I studied by myself. I 
only looked at the geography and looked at my notes from the beginning. I found 
that there were still many things I didn&#39;t know. I was surprised and thought 
that I should not be careless.<br>

Somehow, I had my hair cut yesterday, but I felt very uncomfortable today. When 
I ran in the morning, I put on Wang Fei&#39;s hat and changed my clothes. Maybe it 
was the first one to wear it. The students were curious, and then took it off. 
It was awesome. In the morning, biqingyuan claimed that I had gone back on my 
word. Tai Chenghua also said that for a long time, no matter it!<br>

At noon, I found a needle and nailed the button.<br>

In the afternoon, before class, teacher Fei gave me three manuscripts. I looked 
at them. Two of them were well written. They were icy. One poem, can you think

would write more articles, and I secretly agreed.<br>

said that the papers from other places had been summarized after reading them. 
He said that in the past, people were afraid of the county, but now they don&#39;t 
have to be afraid of other places. I&#39;m so numb that I don&#39;t seem to pay much 
attention to them.<br>

At noon, he met Wang Feng. He held me and asked who was the first. He told me 
the number of times. He told me the number of times in a foreign language. Then 
he asked Wang Ling again. He told me, sighing, I... He is really a friend. He 
can&#39;t be perfect. As long as he has some advantages, I really want to associate 
with him.<br>

novel &quot;difficult equations&quot; and an article introducing her at the beginning. She 
has been admitted to the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. I like that 
novel very much. Can she do that? What about me? Can I catch up with her? I 
secretly made up my mind and have a bright future. Now I have become interested 
in English. Practice has proved that I am not bad at mathematics (I handed out 
the test paper today, 96 points, and most of the class failed). I am proud of 
geography, and the others are dominant. I remembered that during the summer 
vacation of the third day of junior high school, my brother told my parents that 
I would definitely fail in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, but my 
father asked me to fight for it. What can I not win? I still trust myself.<br>

During the morning exercises, you Xuezhong told me that I was not afraid of the 
cold. I was cautious because of the old dog (GE). He had more clothes than me. 
It wasn&#39;t just him, but I endured it and it wasn&#39;t cold either. Qin bin 
straightened my waist, and I stood up. He said to others several times that it 
was very handsome. He said that next time someone told him that I walked 
beautifully, I was happy and wanted to straighten my waist.<br>

In chemistry class, when doing experiments, the teacher found that there was no

walked, I thought about what to take. When I got to the podium, I took a test 
tube and quickly went to fetch water. After a while, I came back and handed it 
to the teacher. I found that Xu Qian looked at me. As soon as I looked at it, I 
had a white knot around my neck, so I thought of holiness and simplicity.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the grade meeting was held, and Director Fu made a half 
semester summary. Later, several students from other classes gave speeches. It 
was OK to see xuqiubao, but I, I secretly decided to work hard in this area and 
be bold, I think.<br>

After doing the exercises between classes in the morning, the Taoist asked me to 
go to the bathroom. I asked fengqingrong for a book because Qin bin wanted it. I 
asked the Taoist to wait. After a while, he went alone. I have asked for books 
from Su Zhengyun for many days. In the afternoon, after the class break, I asked 
Daosheng again. He laughed and refused. I explained, but he had no intention and 
gave up. In the afternoon, after a supplementary test of 50 meters, fengqingrong 
and I ran for 7.4 seconds, and biqingyuan did the same. During the meal, Miss Lu 
Fengmei stopped me and said that it was a student in my class who had something 
in her place. She found it. It turned out that it was Cui Hui&#39;s handout. It was 
crowded when I was trying to fight. Sometimes I was just about to fight, but I 
was suddenly pushed to the back. I was very upset. A little student walked 
straight to the front, and a senior 3 student in front of me shouted &quot;go over!&quot; 
Me.<br>

It&#39;s terrible. I got up late in the morning these days. Although I made up my 
mind at night, I was always replaced by the lazy sleep the next day. When I woke 
up this day, several students got up. They were just confused and seemed to wake 
up. It seemed that there was a kind of consciousness that forced them to sleep 
again, and they thought that this would be beneficial. If they got up, it would 
be destroyed. This was because they dreamed every day, and there were some 
indefinable things in their dreams, Make yourself feel that you are doing 
something that is very relevant to yourself. When you wake up, you feel that it 
is too satisfying to sleep more. But when you get up, you don&#39;t feel much about 
it. Then you know that you have been cheated. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.<br>
<br>
In the morning, she went to hand in something (why not write something). When 
she took the book and handed it over, she felt that she had touched both hands, 
but she didn&#39;t feel anything. It was the same with Xu Qian, but she felt very 
different.<br>

It rained last night, so I won&#39;t do morning exercises today, but I still can&#39;t 
get up. How good I slept at that time!<br>
<br>
This afternoon, I saw the movie &quot;wanted order&quot;. I thought it was very good. I 
didn&#39;t expect that there was such a shocking thing today. The film said that 
after the criminal youmengcai escaped, the Public Security Bureau pursued him. 
At this time, a young woman Huang Xiaodan was killed. She withdrew money from 
the bank and was robbed. She died in a car. The driver was drunk by a woman one 
night. The car was driven to commit a crime. Liangxiaohu is a jobless young man. 
He is called &quot;motorcycle king&quot;. He is in love with Bai Yan. He wants to study 
abroad with his aunt in the United States. Bai Yan disapproves of it, but Bai Du 
(Bai Yange) supports it. Public security personnel find out a gambling boat, but 
youmengcai escapes. After fighting, they catch two of his gambling friends. With 
the help of one of them, they find you, but he escapes again. The public 
security personnel found out that the criminal killed Huang and escaped by 
motorcycle. After a farmer provided clues, it was found that Liang sold the car 
to a classmate. He caught the man. He told Liang that he sold it to him (at a 
low price) and asked him to tell the outside world that it was sold the previous 
month. Therefore, the public security personnel investigated Liang Xiaohu and 
Bai Yan. Bai Yan went to ask Xiaohu. Xiaohu told her that she had done the case. 
Bai Yan told Bai Du when she came home, and Bai Du ordered him to surrender. The 
public security personnel rushed to Xiaohu&#39;s house. Xiaohu had been tricked out 
and killed, and a white police uniform was fished out.<br>
<br>
The public security officer catches you mengcai&#39;s gambler, and he takes you into 
the gambling den. After a fight, he catches you. You is shocked by Xiaohu&#39;s 
death. He confesses that Huang Xiaodan was told to drive and hit her. The man 
got on the car and killed her. He was wearing a white police uniform. It was 
obviously the man who killed Xiaohu. Under the coercion of the public security 
personnel, he finally said that the man was Bai Du. Bai Du is taking his wife 
(the man who cheated the car driver) to escape by plane. The public security 
personnel arrived. They hurried to escape and entered a high-rise building under 
construction. When his wife was really unable to walk, Bai Du kicked her 
downstairs and ran to the top of the building. The public security personnel 
also came up. He put down his suitcase, took out a large number of tickets and 
stuffed them into his chest. Then he ran away. He held the support downstairs. A 
public security officer found him and shouted, He was startled and fell 
downstairs. A large amount of money flashed in the air.<br>

Today, I read the &quot;Water Margin posthumous biography&quot; (Chen Chen). In the book, 
more than 30 liangshanbo heroes who survived the &quot;Water Margin&quot; attack on Fang 
La were gathered together to establish a political power in the Hainiao Hale Luo 
state, and Li Jun became the Lord of the state. The book is obviously far 
fetched, but it can make people happy. Looking at it is like looking at water 
margin.<br>
<br>
After school in the afternoon, those boys were playing table tennis at the table 
in the class. I saw &quot;the story of the outlaws of the marsh&quot;. They were very 
interested. I found that Xu Qian seemed to be interested in it, and I felt very 
unhappy about it. In the evening, I went to bed and talked about songs with Tai 
Chenghua and Chen Bin. After talking about other things, I went to bed for a 
long time.<br>

When I woke up in the morning, I had a vague dream that all the countries in 
Europe, which I contacted or captured, belonged to me. They were pushed back and 
forth on the map like the ground, just like Hitler. In fact, it&#39;s sad that I 
can&#39;t get up. Today is Sunday, and I didn&#39;t have breakfast.<br>
<br>
Today, I am in a bad mood. After reading the book of the outlaws of the marsh 
for a day, I finally finished reading it. I felt very bad. I felt that 
everything I saw was abandoning myself. I knew it was that kind of mood.<br>
<br>
In the morning, biqingyuan said that he really envied us. He wrote on a piece of 
paper, &quot;I don&#39;t have a mother.&quot; ah, no wonder sometimes he is in great pain. I 
really want to cry. Don&#39;t worry, I think he can&#39;t have a mother. That&#39;s too 
terrible. He has no chance to repay his kindness for giving birth to his mother. 
What a blow. The joy of family. This is the best love in the world. I also think 
of my mother. She works hard all day, It&#39;s not easy to provide for the three of 
us to go to school, but I used to bump into her sometimes. I really am. I really 
miss my mother, miss my family, and go back to my loved ones. It&#39;s no longer 
numb. I love my mother. I want her to know my heart. Mom, I swear here.<br>

I got up very late today. I thought it was a dream, but unfortunately I took it 
seriously. Chen Bin said that I dreamt about a poem by Dufu. I think it has 
nothing to do with dreams. It turns out that dream talk has nothing to do with 
dreams.<br>
<br>
Today, I was on duty with biqingyuan in the canteen. I didn&#39;t go in the morning, 
and I didn&#39;t need to go, because people went one after another. I went to the 
duty meeting at noon. Fortunately, there were many people at night. Everyone 
gathered at that time. We could still line up, but there were a lot of people 
and a little crowded. We waited for a good meeting before we had dinner. At 
night, we were just about to go to self-study. Suddenly, there was a power 
failure. So we bought candles with Li Erqiao, but soon the electricity came.<br>
<br>
During the self-study, biqingyuan came in and said that it had snowed. I saw 
that he really had it, so he went out and really did. From time to time, several 
grains of snow fell from the dark sky. This is the first snow this year.<br>

Today, I was in a gloomy mood. It seemed that something was pressing on my head, 
and the atmosphere did not dare to breathe. I felt that everything was becoming 
clear and meaningless. It seemed that everything was false. I was extremely 
pessimistic and could no longer be excited. Alas! I don&#39;t know why.<br>
<br>
The film &quot;death trap&quot;, which was made by the League branch, was at 5:20, but we 
didn&#39;t eat until 5:00. We were busy. When we went, we began to put them away. We 
couldn&#39;t find a seat with biqingyuan. It was No. 6 and No. 8 in row 11 upstairs. 
Later, we knew it was the last row. After we found it, we sat down. Sitting at 
the last side seemed to have an open eye. We could still watch the film. Only 
then did we forget our sadness. The past is coming again, alas!<br>

In the afternoon, the League meeting was held, and Secretary Yao gave a report, 
aiming to be a real League member and play an advanced role. After the meeting, 
Xu Rui went to Xu Rui&#39;s office to borrow his senior one textbook in summer 
vacation. He put it in the box and suddenly changed his view of him, but it was 
wrong. He should return it to me (first) to be a friend or a borrower. Of 
course, I still brought the book. I&#39;ve wanted it for several times, but I&#39;m 
afraid of it. It seems that anything can be done successfully.<br>

At noon, while basking in the sun and reading a book, Wang Feng and I asked each 
other, feeling that their feelings were very valuable. In the afternoon, the 
Secretary of the League branch (Hong Xin) said that the league members held a 
meeting and raised their hands to several students in the class who asked to 
join the league. But we didn&#39;t have a standard. We just raised our hands 
indiscriminately. What&#39;s more, last year, we made a statement for the students 
who joined the league in grade three of senior high school. Those people hadn&#39;t 
seen it before, and they raised their hands indiscriminately several times. It 
was really a great form, and it was a great joke in the world.<br>

It&#39;s really difficult. Teacher Fei asked me to prepare one issue of &quot;stream&quot;, 
but I didn&#39;t have any here. I promised him to hand it in on Saturday, but today 
it&#39;s Friday.<br>
<br>
Wang Fei asked for a piece of autumn rhyme, but it was very short. At noon, he 
suddenly wanted to ask Wang Beiyu again. Sure enough, he had a lot of people, so 
he asked him to copy them. I also collected a piece of physics teacher 
yesterday. In this way, I felt a lot easier.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the lecture in the ladder classroom and felt very 
unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
In the morning, Tai Chenghua sent me a stack of vegetable tickets, which he owed 
me. That&#39;s funny. Two weeks ago, he borrowed one yuan from me, but he never paid 
it back. He didn&#39;t mention it, because his borrowing day was Saturday, and he 
went back. A few days ago, I realized that he had really forgotten this. 
Somehow, I felt very bad about it. It seemed that it was too much. After several 
attempts, he didn&#39;t respond. Yesterday, he came home and begged again. He said 
he didn&#39;t meet his mother and had no money. I was afraid and said, &quot;did you 
forget?&quot; He said, &quot;no,&quot; and I said, &quot;nothing?&quot; When he forgot it, he said, &quot;I 
owe you a dollar, and I won&#39;t forget it.&quot; no mistake, he won&#39;t forget it, but it 
tortured me. At this time, I hold the food ticket and count it in my pocket.<br>

In the evening, teacher Fei asked me to copy the edition of stream. I went to 
another place to arrange the edition. Biqingyuan and Li Erqiao copied it and 
delivered it. He was also called good. He found that there were many books. He 
sighed bitterly. At night, he thought about an article &quot;father and son and son 
and father&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t dream.<br>

Today, I went home and got a ticket at 4 o&#39;clock. After waiting for a meeting, I 
didn&#39;t have a car. I was puzzled. After reading the ticket, it was 14 o&#39;clock. I 
thought I was unlucky. I wanted to run home, but it was dark again. I finally 
ran to the North gate. When I saw two people blocking a car, I got on the bus by 
chance and reached Dazhuo town. I thanked myself, but I was in my heart. When I 
got home, my mother came out of the kitchen and said that I was thin. She asked 
about my grades and told me that I was the second and that I was the first.<br>

In the morning, I went to town with my mother to buy a ski shirt. I was not 
satisfied, so I went to Jurong. Because my ticket was early, my mother told me 
that I had a tractor, so I took it to the north gate and bought a pair of pants 
(28.5 yuan) and a pair of pants (10.5 yuan). It was funny. When I wore them at 
school, the pants were women&#39;s, so I had to change them. When I went to the 
station and waited for the bus, a beggar asked for money. I paid for it. He said 
he would make up for a dime. I didn&#39;t have a dime. He said he would give me a 
dime. It&#39;s funny. Giving alms is also a business. I&#39;ll give it to him later. 
When I got home, I went to the field. My parents asked me, but I didn&#39;t think it 
was good. Later, they said it was OK.<br>

In the morning, I spent a day applying chemical fertilizer (applying chemical 
fertilizer to wheat in the cave), and I met Wang Qin in the field, which was 
very delicate.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I was going to the station. Before I left, my mother told 
grandma Dongmen to cook some eggs for me. I really can&#39;t describe it.<br>
<br>
Ju Hongcheng met Ju Hongcheng at the station. He didn&#39;t see it at first, but he 
smiled. Then he talked, and Bao Jinhua came again. They had a good talk. They 
were very emotional.<br>
<br>
When they arrived at school, biqingyuan and lihongtao both said that they looked 
like women and were very proud of themselves. So did Wang Fei. This is what will 
be said later.<br>

Today is very comfortable and I feel good. At noon, just after class, I went 
outside. Suddenly, I heard a voice calling me. Seeing that it was my father, I 
ran down. It turned out that it was rice delivery. When I got to the dormitory, 
he left. On the way, I suddenly saw Xu Qian coming. He seemed to stop nearby. I 
was very puzzled. I went to the library to read the newspaper. Suddenly Guan 
Hong said to change the paper. I scored 90 points in the geography exam. It was 
not difficult. Suddenly, I had unlimited confidence again. Later, due to the 
highest score, the teacher re read it for 85 points, which is still the highest, 
and many people even scored 60 points. I have an absolute advantage in this.<br>

In the afternoon, I went to the reading room and read the history monthly. I 
thought it was very useful, but the time was too short. I just hated that I 
couldn&#39;t come on weekdays. Today, at my self-study, I compared the world with 
Chinese history and suddenly became clear. It was very good. I recited a rhyming 
poem in the evening.<br>

At noon, I played badminton with biqingyuan. Later, Chen Bin came to play 
badminton. He saw a group of students reading the blackboard newspaper, so he 
went to see it. It turned out that the intelligence contest was announced 
(League Organization). We were the first (69) and I was the second (68) in grade 
two of senior high school. I was very happy. Somehow, I remembered whether Xu 
Qian had seen it or not. Later, I went to camp and ate a box of canned pork with 
biqingyuan. It was not good, but it was very &quot;communism&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the library and read the book of literary and 
historical knowledge. In the evening, I studied by myself. Hongxin, Secretary of 
the League branch in the class, gave me a set of colored pens, which were the 
prizes of the competition. So I gave two pens to Chen Bin and two pens to 
biqingyuan, and left two for myself. It was over.<br>

When I woke up very early in the morning and couldn&#39;t find my ski shirt, I knew 
that I fell to the ground. When I picked it up, I saw my watch fall on the bed. 
I was deeply responsible for my poor sleep at night. After class and biqingyuan 
went to get the meal ticket, they found the wallet open. They were puzzled that 
the money was gone. I thought I might have fallen into bed and couldn&#39;t find it. 
Suddenly, I linked up with the morning incident and suddenly realized that he 
had been stolen. I thought I was unlucky and told my classmates. Later, Wang 
Ling said that he had been stolen 20 yuan. I was six yuan, and Tai Chenghua also 
said one yuan. At noon, chenxiaoxiang said that 15 yuan had been stolen, so he 
told the teacher. We guessed it was one, analyzed it for a long time, and 
scolded at night, but it didn&#39;t end. It was really the work of the class. 
Therefore, without taking my watch (guess it was su), he paid attention to it, 
but felt like it, so he really thought it was.<br>

In the morning, I talked about the thief again. I was more and more sure of him. 
I saw that he was furtive.<br>
<br>
When I went to class, I read through the window. Liang, seeing that Xu Qian was 
also holding a book and reading it together, was not shy. He forbeared to learn. 
Where is it?<br>
<br>
At noon, we played badminton with biqingyuan. First we played badminton in the 
school, then we went to study school. After playing badminton, we had to go to 
sleep. Later, we took a nap in class and stopped it.<br>
<br>
Today, there was a power failure. I went out with biqingyuan to have a talk. I 
felt a little friendly.<br>
<br>
In the evening, there was another scolding about thieves.<br>
<br>
Chen Bin, Tai Chenghua and other scholars speak of the beauty of the royal 
mausoleum, which is attributed to the wealth of geography? Love? I can&#39;t help 
being annoyed, and Xu Qian is not comforted, and a little ashamed. Suddenly I 
saw a book that said &quot;there is no fragrant grass anywhere in the world&quot;. Yes! 
&quot;There is no fragrant grass anywhere in the world&quot;. Who will win and who will 
lose in the big world in the future?<br>

At noon, I went to Mr. Ji&#39;s office to talk about the theft. Mr. Ji said that he 
also planned to talk about it. He wanted to find out his ears.<br>
<br>
Evening self-study and biqingyuan decided to take the history and geography 
examination in the future, with a score of more than 95. The name is &quot;higher 
requirements&quot;. I want to try my best to do it.<br>
<br>

<br>
When I woke up this morning, I didn&#39;t think of it. It was difficult for me not 
only because of the story, but also because of the theft. Today, I am at the end 
of my tether. There are no oneortwo meal tickets and none of the food tickets. I 
borrowed a ten kilogram meal ticket from Tai Chenghua and then a one yuan 
vegetable ticket from Wang Fei. How can I help you? How can I help you?<br>
<br>
Today, I saw Liang Shangfei. In fact, the more I saw him, the more I looked at 
him. Finally, I thought he was Liang Shangfei. I watched him everywhere and 
defended him everywhere.<br>
<br>
At noon, Mr. Ji led all the students to the camping camp to check the beds and 
boxes. The main task was to check them. If they really only checked them, they 
thought it was too clear.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to Mr. Ji&#39;s office and talked about it again, but it didn&#39;t work 
out after all. Thinking of this, I am more homesick. After thinking about it, 
compared with all kinds of people, only my parents really hurt me. Others are 
also false! It&#39;s just a moment! How I want to dedicate a piece of my heart to my 
bitter parents. Why not?<br>

I washed my clothes at noon. It has been two weeks since I took off. I was 
always afraid of washing them. I just delayed. I washed them because I wanted to 
go back to get money this week. In fact, I washed them once, but I was lazy.<br>
<br>
I went to the library and saw the change of Guan Zi. I felt very good. Later, I 
went to the reference room (open to the third year of senior high school) to 
check the Jurong land directory. I found that Shangyin was the place where 
taokan built his camp. Dazhuo was the temple of Zhenwu emperor. The big one was 
zhuoye, and the outstanding one was tall. The map can be found in every village.<br>
<br>
Today, I know that I have no money. I can&#39;t buy anything. I&#39;m forced everywhere. 
I think more about how my family is living. I&#39;m very ashamed!<br>

When I woke up in the morning, it was still dark. How about Gai? When I went 
outside, I saw a candle light in class 3 of senior high school. I knew someone 
was reading a book. It was so hard. But now, it should be hard. Then I went to 
bed, fell asleep for a moment, and woke up, but I didn&#39;t think of it.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the school held a meeting. President Wang said that it was to 
strengthen ideological education. Now the students&#39; thinking has actually 
regressed. It&#39;s funny. I can&#39;t figure it out and I don&#39;t want to figure it out. 
After the evening self-study, Qingyuan said that he was troubled and often 
thought that people were in danger. I only said that I should not think about it 
at present. It will be a long time to get into a good school. However, I also 
admit that I think that human nature is good, and the environment is not right.<br>

When we went to play ball with biqingyuan during the break, we suddenly saw Wang 
Qun. She also went to the dormitory. She felt proud. She seemed to dodge, but 
she didn&#39;t give up. After a few glances, she was still an old friend, but I felt 
aggrieved.<br>
<br>
At noon, when we went to the street with biqingyuan, we suddenly felt that there 
was an inferiority complex, which was the same with him. Xiuchang often watched 
Pingshui, but we didn&#39;t see him watching it. It was really puzzling.<br>

Today, I decided to go home. Because I had stolen 6 yuan, I was heavily in debt. 
The financial aid had not been issued yet. I had already pinned my hope on him. 
At noon, I went to buy a ticket with Chen Bin. Then I ran around the newly-built 
&quot;Jurong threehundred goods company&quot; and &quot;people&#39;s shopping mall&quot;, and I felt 
ashamed. Gaiyin&#39;s family (of course a few) were well dressed. You can see Li 
Erqiao, even more. In fact? But the heart is very bitter.<br>
<br>
Go home. Walking up to the arch bridge, I saw a woman busy in her own field. She 
stood for a while and couldn&#39;t look at herself. Unfortunately, she couldn&#39;t see 
clearly. She knew it was her mother, but she was so well dressed and was 
uncertain. Then I called me faintly. I ran to the field. She was fertilizing. 
She was really her mother, so I called. She dressed really well (later I knew 
she came back from drinking wine). I asked me, and I helped her. I wanted to 
talk to her, but I had nothing to say, so I had to blame myself. After a while, 
my father passed by the roadside and said, &quot;Yimin is back.&quot; I quickly answered 
him and called &quot;Dad&quot;. He went to send money to my brother. He wore pants full of 
patches. They were white and blue. I didn&#39;t feel sad. How much effort my parents 
spent on our three brothers. When I got home, my grandmother burned two eggs, 
but I felt like I had a debt or love!<br>
<br>
In the evening, my father wanted to fry melon seeds. He specially fried fried 
rice with oil and gave me one to eat. They all ate porridge. Dad brought me new 
cotton padded shoes to change. I really wanted to earn money and be filial at 
once. However, he gave me 15 yuan, and I gave him 5 yuan. I didn&#39;t tell them 
about the loss. I really didn&#39;t want them to add another worry and two silver 
hairs. Before going to bed at night, I sincerely took a pot with me. I really 
want to be close to him and make him feel sentimental, but I can&#39;t do anything.<br>

I woke up very late. It was the best sleep in several days. In the morning, I 
asked my grandmother to sew sweatpants and sleeves, and my mother washed my ski 
shirt. At lunch, I cooked three eggs, and my father always let me eat them. I am 
really. When I was cooking, my mother said that there were 6 eggs last time and 
10 eggs this time. When I grew up, my grandmother made a insole for me. It was 
nice and hard. She said that my father carried so many meters (55 kilograms) 
last time. I was sorry when I grew up, and he didn&#39;t buy a bus ticket when he 
came back. He took the bus in the shade. He didn&#39;t tell me that I couldn&#39;t write 
anymore. I didn&#39;t know when my ticket was gone when I took the bus. I was in a 
hurry. I wanted to stop near the station. If I did, there was no way out. But I 
was in a bad mood.<br>

<br>
This morning, when I woke up, I still didn&#39;t think of doing exercises. Few 
people went there. After a while, Mr. Wu came to the dormitory, and we got up. 
Although I got up late, I got up much earlier than before. It turned out that I 
was lack of motivation and slept late at night.<br>
<br>
Today, Xu Qian&#39;s clothes are still the same as before. I shouldn&#39;t be forced to 
dress.<br>
<br>
At noon, the school arranged a private movie &quot;the wreath under the mountain&quot;. I 
saw the novel in the summer vacation when I was in junior high school. I cried 
twice. This movie cried twice. The novel went to the company to pay the bill 
with Yuxiu and his mother on the death of three joys. The film was written by 
jinxiaozhu, who asked his father not to blow up his leg and told his grandmother 
when he fell. He really regretted thinking of his grandmother! There was another 
time when Yu Xiu was crying at the tomb. I can&#39;t tell the beauty of the novel, 
but I shed real tears.<br>
<br>
I read some college entrance examination papers today, and I think it is much 
clearer.<br>

I am not in a good mood. I seem to have lost something. I feel lacking in my 
heart. I feel a little interested in English today. I must learn it well, I 
think.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, Tai Chenghua had a sweet potato. Later, Wang Fengzhi, I felt 
that I hadn&#39;t talked with him for a long time. I gave him half a potato for a 
while, and he was willing to accept it.<br>
<br>
At noon, I met XURUI, stopped him and asked him if he would go back? He said 
maybe, so I asked him to bring me a piece of steel, which was ordered by grandma 
when he was leaving home. Alas! Why should I be so considerate? I am powerless 
again.<br>
<br>
At noon, I met Tang Bing, the third year of senior high school. When he was 
teacher Fei, he called. He didn&#39;t know first, then smiled, and gave a vague 
promise. It was really funny.<br>
<br>
Frustrated and left out? Why is there no lack of anything, but an empty heart?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0116<br>
<br>
My heart is very poor, and I have become like that again. Alas, I don&#39;t know 
when to stay this time. Today, I sent out my winter vacation homework and did 
some Chinese to review, which is also a good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0117<br>
<br>
Still like that, my heart is very heavy. I played table tennis for a class in 
physical education. It was very interesting, but I didn&#39;t know anything after 
that. It was still so boring. Learning from the bitter experience, it seems that 
there is no answer, but is it because the clothes don&#39;t agree (snowboarding 
shirt)? Today, our class won the volleyball match with classes 3 and 4 (men).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0118<br>
<br>
The history quiz, the paper is very simple (in my opinion), basically done 
right, it seems that this learning method is very good. I read the geography by 
myself in the evening, and I can master it well. Foreign languages and 
mathematics should be strengthened. I believe in myself. I can&#39;t look down on 
mathematics.<br>
<br>
Today, I gave out the financial aid, which was originally 12.2 yuan (9.2 yuan 
plus 3 yuan scholarship), deducted the tuition (the book fee was not paid in 
full), and there was still 6.05 yuan left. I decided to work harder and bring 
the money to my family so that I could send some hope.<br>
<br>
At dinner, Xu Rui asked paizizi to go back. Later, he found him and asked him to 
bring some more dishes. He couldn&#39;t tell. He was dumb.<br>
<br>

It&#39;s the end of the exam, the holiday and the Chinese New Year. Let me stop 
&quot;Rizhi&quot; and relax. Alas, it shouldn&#39;t be the end, no!<br>

This morning, I suddenly remembered that I should show zhengrenxiang (female 
classmate) what I had written in the past, so I copied some. I was very nervous 
and gave them to her after school. At noon, talking with Wang Feng in front of 
the classroom, Zheng suddenly came to me and said that it was well written. She 
said she couldn&#39;t understand it. The couplet was very good. She asked me if I 
wrote it. I was so surprised. She gave me a piece of writing paper. Wang Feng 
took it to read it and promised to copy it for me. Of course, I couldn&#39;t wait 
for it. When I got home, my brother&#39;s language platform had 280 yuan and 100 
dollars. I was very proud.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
I really couldn&#39;t sleep last night. I thought a lot. But she was also in a very 
good mood. She wore a suit (Su University uniform). Before she left, her mother 
cooked four more eggs. She always ate more than ten eggs every time she came 
home. She was very kind and thought about the future. After Jurong left with 
XURUI, I bought a white shirt (more than 8 yuan) and a tie (4 yuan). I felt good 
wearing it. People also paid attention to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning, she handed the manuscript to zhengrenxiang, but after a while, 
she said she would hand it in, but he (teacher Fei) didn&#39;t approve of it, so he 
said to leave it to her. Of course, I wouldn&#39;t allow it. She said yes when she 
asked for it back!<br>
<br>
After telling Wang Feng, he went to the street to buy manuscript paper. In the 
evening, he re selected it and sent it to liwenru, the editor of the Chinese 
daily. After self-study in the evening, he copied it and sent it. It will fly 
away with a piece of hope for me.<br>

After the second class this afternoon, teacher Fei asked us to have a meeting. 
I, Liu Hui, zhengrenxiang, qianxiaoyu, and an unknown female student (who speaks 
Mandarin well and belongs to the student union) said that a literary society 
should be established. I would be happy to speak first. I think it&#39;s good to 
call it &quot;Maoshan literature society&quot;. They don&#39;t agree. I don&#39;t think so when 
they say &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;ginkgo&quot;. Later, I proposed that I should recite some 
ancient Chinese, but they said that reading and writing novels were different. 
Later, teacher Fei asked Liu Hui to be president, but she pushed me. Of course, 
I didn&#39;t want to participate, so teacher Fei went down the stairs. Later, they 
argued with me about ancient Chinese. Liu Hui said, &quot;poisoning&quot;, and I said, 
&quot;benefit&quot;. I said that it was boring to run a literary club. It was better to 
break up. Qian also ran, Liu said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter if 
you don&#39;t have me.&quot; otherwise, the girl said that Mao Zedong and his colleagues 
run newspapers very well. I said that they share the same aspirations, but now 
they have different aspirations, but they are determined to quit. Later, when I 
was having dinner, zhengrenxiang told me that she didn&#39;t want to participate, 
but she didn&#39;t have the courage to join me. Now she retired, and I said, &quot;just 
in time.&quot;. It seems that she admires my ancient poems. I don&#39;t know why others 
don&#39;t know. She always said that I couldn&#39;t eat well, so I had to change my 
tune. Then I finally left, but I didn&#39;t know what to do. I found &quot;ancient prose 
Guanzhi&quot; and read it!<br>

Last night, we were talking about communism. I used to say I didn&#39;t believe it. 
I must feel sad that I had done something wrong. But now I think it is also a 
science and a religion. Like Christianity, the capital, that is, the Bible. A 
man who is not a big cause should also be open and aboveboard. Why should he be 
bound by others? Marx hasn&#39;t met yet. Why do you believe in him? I can say: not 
believing in communism is just like not believing in Christianity, but it&#39;s just 
a matter of justice. However, some people say that the horse is swollen when 
they see the camel. Their mouth and heart are different. They should believe it 
if they believe it. If they don&#39;t believe it, they should not force it.<br>
<br>
I think we should believe in ourselves, and I think people should: 1. Pursue the 
true meaning of heaven and earth; 2. Be innocent. We should have a foothold in 
the present, do what we do now, and talk about what kind of society we can live 
in. We can talk about the realization of communism one day, but one day the 
earth will explode. What else can we live in? Sad husband!<br>

Yesterday, I took the geography test. I thought it was very good, and made an 
exception to hand in the paper in advance. Later, when I went to have dinner, I 
just took the box. The teacher shouted at me and showed me the paper (which had 
just been changed). I didn&#39;t know how good it was. Once I saw it, it was only 
&quot;86&quot;, which was very bad in my heart. Later, I handed it in. He analyzed it for 
me, and it was all right in my heart.<br>
<br>
Today, he said that the highest score was 89 points. Before I finished the 
correction, my heart stopped. Is it true that I am behind others? I really 
didn&#39;t mention it in my heart. But I must catch up.<br>

At noon, he played a hairball with sunguanghai. It was very hot. Later, Xu Qian 
also played with a classmate. Unexpectedly, he was very happy. He first met Xu 
Qian outside and expected to meet her. After dinner, she fought with biqingyuan 
again. Xu Qian went to see the blackboard again. Because she was close to me, 
she was very suspicious. Alas, she was amorous.<br>
<br>
I had to go to bed when I was studying at night. Then I fell on biqingyuan&#39;s 
lap. He teased my hair and told me about his past. It was actually an affair. 
Several female students were subtle. He said it was one of the pessimistic 
factors, but I was not.<br>
<br>
He said that he was ill, and he was also very pessimistic. He also talked about 
his family. One night&#39;s self-study passed.<br>

In the morning, in geometry class, Mr. Zhang said that liberal arts should learn 
mathematics well, and gave several examples, so I really wanted to learn. He 
said that Mr. Ji told me that I was a material of Nanjing University. The 
teachers knew all about me, so the students looked at me. I pretended not to 
know, but I was very happy. I must live up to my teacher.<br>
<br>
At about 4:20 after the evening school, I suddenly saw thick smoke billowing 
outside the dormitory. I went to see it with wangbeiyu. The smoke kept rolling 
and spilled to the north. Everyone on the road was running, watching and 
talking. There was also regret. It turned out that the gasoline depot of the bus 
was on fire. One barrel after another exploded and burned. The road was crowded 
with people watching, but they couldn&#39;t. The smoke was blowing out, and from 
time to time the fire swept over the smoke.<br>
<br>
The fire burned for two hours before the Nanjing fire brigade came to put it 
out. When I went to the scene with wangbeiyu and Ren Guangrong, I saw a layer of 
white things on it, and the sky was still floating. Holding it in my hand, it 
was foam. It turned out that it was dry ice to put out the fire.<br>
<br>
After dark, I went back to my dormitory.<br>

When I woke up in the morning, I felt very late. Because it was Sunday, I 
reluctantly went to bed again. Later, I felt very late. It was more than 9 
o&#39;clock, but it was only 7 o&#39;clock when I looked at my watch. I got up and read 
a Book - &quot;the poet&quot;: &quot;at dawn, I will set off...&quot; Photography and painting, 
stone and jade with poetry, were very moved and played cards later. After 
dinner, I went to Chen Bin to get clothes and lent him a suit to dance. At noon, 
I read the book University. The golden mean. I thought it was very right, so I 
had a little faith.<br>
<br>
Later, when Xu Qian came to read a book, she was a little angry.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to play basketball. It was so hot that I wanted to drink water. 
When they went to the street with Li Erqiao and Daosheng, they walked aimlessly. 
Later, they asked each other where there was tea. Later, they thought that there 
was no tea seller in the dark? Not funny.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to the kiosk to buy soft drinks. I asked the saleswoman if she had 
sparkling wine. I said she would get drunk or drink it with it. I asked her if 
she had boiled water. She said no, and smiled down. She felt funny. Tao Sheng 
and Li Erqiao also laughed. Later, they returned to class and drank some cold 
water. They dared not drink more.<br>

It&#39;s very windy today. It&#39;s a little cold. Fortunately, Tai Chenghua gave me a 
suit and a sweater last night. I really thank him. Teacher Fei asked me how to 
do it. He said that they must set up a literary society and zhengrenxiang must 
participate in it. In the end, I refused. Guo Wei said that they were sorry, but 
not reluctantly. I have several reasons: 1. I don&#39;t want to write articles. I 
just want to read books. Because I recite ancient Chinese and have different 
aspirations, the Tao is different. 2. To be admitted to a university, 3. Teacher 
Fei didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. He didn&#39;t see how it was. 4. Middle school 
students can&#39;t become a big climate. What&#39;s the meaning?<br>
<br>
Most of the girls in the class want to go on a spring outing in Yangzhou, but 
some of the boys don&#39;t want to go. Li Erqiao was determined not to go. I didn&#39;t 
want to go, but I will go again later. They are all more determined. Now they 
don&#39;t want to go. They are still determined. I don&#39;t know why.<br>
<br>
Zhengrenxiang, the team leader, asked me to go. I said that they (mawenxiang and 
Li Erqiao) would not go, nor would I. but she still insisted that I would not. 
Fengqingrong asked me to go, and biqingyuan also pretended that I would go, but 
I still refused. Later, zhengrenxiang said that they (Hong Xin and them) also 
wanted me to go. Xu Qian also looked at me, but I still didn&#39;t go. She told the 
monitor, Tan Derong, but after a while she knew that only three people in group 
two would not go, so she went to tan Derong again to sue.<br>
<br>
In the morning, he said to Chen Bin, &quot;you are a bad person with many 
shortcomings&quot;, and told him that he doesn&#39;t care about feelings and it&#39;s 
difficult to have close friends. In the afternoon, he held me by the shoulder 
and said, &quot;after thinking for a long time, I decided to change my mind, stay 
with me, open up a base area (two people alone) and reunite.&quot; I was very excited 
and asked him why he broke the mirror? How many times have you been reunited in 
ancient times? He said that we were the first to meet and befriend each other 
(sophomore year of high school). In the past, I said, &quot;those days are 
unforgettable.&quot; It&#39;s really decided. Can you?<br>
<br>
I wonder why I can be loved? Why do those women want me to go? He was too 
sentimental and said: No. According to the past: Ju Hongcheng, Zhengbao, 
gaoxianzhong, Wang Feng, Chen Bin and biqingyuan can all express their 
sincerity. I have been rewarded by my teacher for many times, but I am 
incompetent.<br>
<br>
However, the early love in my heart is the same every time: for example, Chen 
Lan, wutinghua, wangdaoyin, renjuan, wangguofang, lixiaoxia, Wang Qun and Xu 
Qian, how far away they are? It&#39;s pure and absurd to forget them once they pass.<br>

It&#39;s strange that they always say that huangjianlan and I are interesting, but I 
know nothing about it. Guy mawenxiang said that when he was just a sophomore in 
senior high school, he held cultural and recreational activities. He asked me to 
sing a song and said, &quot;my class study committee member&quot; said, but I didn&#39;t know. 
I only knew that Hong Xin, the Secretary of the League branch, called me. But Li 
Erqiao took it seriously and talked more and more about it. Later, many people 
believed me and made fun of me. It was really &quot;everyone locked in the money, but 
I didn&#39;t mean it at all. Isn&#39;t it too bad? Where&#39;s Xuqian? Why did they talk 
nonsense last night? I didn&#39;t mean to.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the class said that there were 10 people dancing. Of course, 
there was no me. People&#39;s minds are in danger, so why envy them. After dinner, I 
went shopping with Li Erqiao. After that, I mended my leather shoes (up the 
line), which was full of melon seeds.<br>

This afternoon, mawenxiang and I had a heart to heart talk, and we started 
talking like two hearts. He told me that some of fengqingrong&#39;s love affairs 
actually involved Chen Jun. although I knew something about it, I didn&#39;t believe 
that Chen Jun would do so. So I tried to ask him in a tone of disbelief. He said 
to me: in an examination of Physical Education (written), such as volleyball 
knowledge, Chen Jun had a note with Feng, which Feng told mawenxiang. I also 
knew that Chen Jun told him to choose blindly when he was taking an English test 
(the time was up, and the multiple-choice question was not done well). However, 
this is true. I can&#39;t pity my husband! Mawenxiang also sued me. Feng first 
intended to change, but now he wants to change when he sees something different. 
But what about me? Cheated? Alas! Let&#39;s use a sentence: &quot;sentimental people are 
always heartlessly annoyed&quot;. It turns out that this is the case. You are 
sentimental, but you have a good feeling in your heart.<br>
<br>
However, I don&#39;t think so. Isn&#39;t it true that it&#39;s not impossible for me to do 
it? Isn&#39;t it just a joke? Yes, there are plenty of people in the world. Can you 
feel sorry for someone who shouldn&#39;t? &quot;Let it be fragrant&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mawenxiang also said that he could not trust anyone. He would do unexpected 
things at some time. I call it &quot;forced by the environment&quot;. I am always on the 
theory of good nature. Ma also said that my heart was too good. There was 
nothing else. I was so happy. They talked about self-study for the whole evening 
while doing their homework. Later, Chen Bin came and blamed us. I played with 
him, but he was very angry. Did we hinder others&#39; study? The voice is not high! 
Chen Bin, what can I say?<br>
<br>
In a word, the more you think about it, the more wrong you are. Chen Jun, you 
are too sorry for me. Of course, you can&#39;t blame you. It&#39;s also forced by the 
environment. I just blame myself for being amorous. It&#39;s really &quot;people&#39;s hearts 
are in danger&quot;. But what about the ends of the earth?<br>
<br>

I talked with sunspot this morning. Now I feel that he is the only one who knows 
me. But I used to be bad with him and hate him. I really shouldn&#39;t have. He said 
that I have changed. I am not shy like before. I like talking with people, but I 
don&#39;t know whether it is better or worse. I think we should study hard now and 
stop making friends with people. They have no ambition. How can they talk about 
it? It&#39;s hard to find a bosom friend, but you can&#39;t force yourself. I just think 
he is good.<br>
<br>
In the morning, the geography teacher said that the high terrain of the Qinghai 
Tibet Plateau was bad. I thought of Yugong removing mountains. He told Liang 
Shucai that the Chinese people should carry forward the spirit of Yugong 
removing mountains and move it elsewhere. He laughed and said later that it 
would be moved to Vietnam. He was really impressed.<br>
<br>
After lunch, he told Li Erqiao that if he raised a pig, he would cut a piece of 
meat every day and eat it like this when it grew up. He said that like his 
brother, I had some fantasies.<br>
<br>
At noon, I grabbed my tune with Li Erqiao, but I broke off with a slight turn. 
It was really fun. At this time, a voice called &quot;Yimin&quot;. When he saw that it was 
his uncle, he shouted a few more times, so he went downstairs and took him to 
the dormitory. He told him where the dormitory was. He came to the timber 
company again and told him about the spring outing. He gave me two yuan. I said 
it was enough, but he forced me to give it. Really, he came to the daily 
newspaper.<br>
<br>
Before the evening self-study, I had a heart to heart talk with sunspots, about 
the past, about my first year of high school, about one of the people in the 
universe, about my family members, and about going to college. He first said to 
go, but I said I would not go. I talked in the school room for a long time. We 
have many common views. People are too poor. Everything is boring. We are 
disillusioned with the world. Our family is very kind to themselves, and said 
that we must go to a good school. Yes, study hard! We will, get rid of all 
distractions.<br>

During the evening self-study, Liang Shuli destroyed several cards. Because he 
was so hurt, he played cards in all his spare time. I used to do the same. 
Later, I resolutely changed it, but they didn&#39;t change it. It&#39;s a big 
attraction! After a while, Mr. Ji asked me to go to his dormitory to talk with 
me about the situation in the class. He asked me and answered. I said that the 
study atmosphere was not strong and my thoughts were complex, but he asked me to 
talk about discipline. I was not interested in it and didn&#39;t talk much about it. 
But after a long time, he went back to class and talked to someone else. He said 
that I had good grades and learned well. He also said that I had a good 
foundation on my report card last semester. I still remember my feelings. 
Someone told him that I was reading novels. He said that I was about to do this, 
but now I have to study hard in mathematics, English and history.<br>

Today is Tomb Sweeping Day. I should have gone to Zhaowen mountain to visit the 
tomb, but it rained, so I just went to Gaoyi. After class, many people went to 
the toilet. I chanted: &quot;it rains in succession during the Qingming Festival, and 
passers-by on the road want to break their souls. I would like to ask where the 
restaurant is. The shepherd boy pointed to the apricot blossom village from 
afar.&quot; And pointed to the toilet, Wang Ling also with, ridiculous.<br>

At noon, Li Erqiao spoke in front of the railing. Biqingyuan, fengqingrong, Hua 
tinggan and Tang Pingping listened. Of course, there was me. He said Xu Qun 
said, &quot;this guy is the ugliest.&quot; It used to mean me. I became dumb when my heart 
got angry. He also said that Xu said Bi Qingyuan was the most vicious, but what 
about me? Somehow, it seemed that I had suffered a great grievance, but it also 
seemed that it was true. Later, I read a book and slept with my hands on my 
back. I thought that I might have stayed for a while, but I couldn&#39;t figure it 
out. But have you been cheated? After physics class in the afternoon, I 
reluctantly told Bi that I was angry. He said vicious words that hurt people. A 
pretty young man was said to be the ugliest. I hope so. However, I don&#39;t think 
why he said this. Does everyone think he is beautiful (me too), or &quot;people&#39;s 
hearts are in danger?&quot; This year, the epidemic of brain disease is very popular. 
We won&#39;t go on a spring outing. Just as it happens, I don&#39;t want to. People&#39;s 
minds are in danger. After dinner, I wash my hair and comb my hair alone in the 
dormitory. I have to dress up. But the heart is very sad, &quot;bad words have been 
cold for ten years.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

I feel dizzy. Now I want to come. It&#39;s like a dream.<br>
<br>
I got up very late in the morning. I couldn&#39;t eat breakfast as usual. After 
washing, I was at a loss. I had to comb my hair in the mirror. What kind of hair 
might I comb? I don&#39;t know. After washing my clothes, I was at a loss for what 
to do this morning. Is it all for Xu Qun?<br>
<br>
After lunch, he went shopping with Da Hongwei. After that, he went to the Xinhua 
Bookstore to read a book. He didn&#39;t buy a vocabulary for his brother. He was 
very sad and pitiful. When I returned to my dormitory, I went to bed. I thought 
of everything at home in the past. It&#39;s not sad. Everything can make me cry and 
make me sad.<br>
<br>
Alas! Can&#39;t I cheer up? My career matters. Am I really ugly? My mother said that 
when I was a child, Ragon said that I was better than my brother. My neighbor, 
Huang Ming&#39;s mother, said that a man is better than me, just like me. Zhengfang 
said to my mother, &quot;your second son is like a city man.&quot; People are willing to 
make friends with me. Isn&#39;t that true? If you can believe it, people&#39;s hearts 
are in danger.<br>
<br>
Of course, learning matters. I don&#39;t often say, &quot;is going to college better than 
anything?&quot; If not, who am I worthy of? Father, mother, uncle, aunt, uncle, aunt, 
grandmother, mother-in-law, brothers, cousins, villagers, teachers and 
classmates. Oh, really.<br>
<br>
In the evening self-study class, he talked with mawenxiang about it. He thought 
it was not the case. He said I could. Xu Wei was jealous (I wore a suit). He 
says he can&#39;t do as well as I can. He said it was true, I think so. He said I 
looked like a little guy in garrison expendables. I think it&#39;s true. I&#39;m not 
bad. Alas! I&#39;ve really been cheated. Let&#39;s stop talking.<br>

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m pessimistic today. I can&#39;t help it. In the afternoon, there 
will be a class cadre meeting (I am a study committee member) to discuss 
discipline issues, focusing on &quot;management&quot;. They were very warm, and I said 
nothing but felt uneasy. Ability? No? But I deny that I am no longer interested 
in &quot;management&quot;. Everyone wants to take the college entrance examination. 
Otherwise, how can I be worthy of my parents? I will manage myself well.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the afternoon, I took the history exam, but I didn&#39;t review it. I was so 
afraid. I really hope I can take the exam later. I didn&#39;t think it was difficult 
after the exam, especially after three questions and answers and a few questions 
and answers in a row, it was very easy after the exam. Fortunately, I took the 
exam, otherwise I would be reimbursed for one night&#39;s self-study.<br>
<br>
I got 99 points in the math test. I&#39;m optimistic about it. I&#39;m not worse than 
others.<br>

The cultural and entertainment committee member brought a tape recorder in the 
afternoon and played Zhou Feng&#39;s song in the afternoon. It was very pleasant to 
hear. Before the evening self-study, I bought many flavored melon seeds 
according to my promise. I bet with Bi Qingwu that Mr. Ji wanted to talk to him, 
but he didn&#39;t talk. But my promise was fulfilled. I understand.<br>
<br>
Talking about life with biqingyuan and Li Erqiao, I said that if I wanted to 
open up, it would be boring. If one day is boring, life is just eating and 
dressing, and one has to die, it is inevitable. This is called disillusionment 
with the world of mortals, but I am a higher class. If I know that I want to 
open up, I don&#39;t want to open up!<br>
<br>
When talking about songs, I said that the epidemic was good, but Bi might be, 
for example, the flu. I still said that it was good for the cold. Don&#39;t think 
about people. He was still strong. I said that this disease is better than other 
diseases, just because it can be popular and known. Li Erqiao acquiesced, saying 
that the world is like this. There are no bad things. I think there are no bad 
things. Everything is for survival. People only divide the good and the bad 
according to their own wishes, like bees and spiders. In fact, my view is very 
reasonable.<br>

At noon, Qin Bin took a copy of &quot;looking at the Sino Soviet war from the records 
of important military areas&quot; (Sugita Ciyi). I took it and immediately attracted 
it. It turned out that they were optimistic about China and the Soviet Union. 
Unexpectedly, there was such a serious territorial problem that they could not 
decide whether to fight or not. The Soviet Union and its satellite countries, 
Mongolia, Vietnam (Laos, Cambodia), Afghanistan, as well as the Allies North 
Korea and India (Sikkim), the eastern sea of China, and the Soviet Union&#39;s 
Pacific Fleet blockade. Only when China is friendly with Japan, the United 
States and Western Europe can it. When they returned to their dormitories to 
blow the Sino Soviet war, some of them only made empty comments. It can be seen 
that it is important to say something based on facts. However, we (dormitory) 
all hope that war will break out. I don&#39;t know why.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the history class, Mr. Ji told me that GE Yunfei had set the sea to fight 
against the British, saying that he had the same surname as me. In history, the 
surnames of Ge liaoliao, Ge Rong, Ge Xian and Ge Hong were pathetic, but start 
from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0413<br>
<br>
Give out the composition, 82 points. Da Hongwei&#39;s comment is &quot;there is a sound 
on the ground today in Japanese, wait and see what you can do at your feet&quot;. He 
writes the truth.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I saw a Qigong performance (xuyunpeng). It was not good, but 
the momentum was not small. I washed my coat in a hurry in the evening and 
waited for it to dry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0414<br>
<br>
As usual, I didn&#39;t have breakfast, and then I ate some fried rice, which was 
very fragrant. At noon, I went to repair my watch. I broke the wind up button 
and spent one yuan. When he came back, he saw a woman in front of a group of 
people, like the player in class 3. Suddenly, a voice called him. Then a Chenjun 
came with his mother and told him to go to Nanjing. He also said that he would 
return that day. He was ashamed that he would be very good. Let him go, No. In 
the evening, I took a bath and borrowed two yuan from Tai Chenghua.<br>

In the morning, Li Erqiao in the upper bunk said that he hadn&#39;t slept all night. 
I was afraid of getting up very much. Later, during the general cleaning, Ma 
Wenxiang cleaned for Li Erqiao and me for a while. All day is a word: ashamed, 
bored and tired.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0416<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I saw the movie &quot;new fangshiyu&quot;, but I didn&#39;t see a good one. 
The plot was very similar. I watched martial arts completely, and Li Erqiao said 
the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0417<br>
<br>
At noon, Xu Rui told me in the canteen that my mother was coming. He had a 
feeling of joy and fear. He was ashamed. When I saw my mother after the meal, I 
went to the dormitory instead. She said my clothes were dirty and that I had 
lost a button (really thin). She insisted on giving me a laundry newspaper and 
told me that Yinong had bought a suit (40 yuan). After washing, she went to 
catch the bus. She brought me a quilt to change and a bag of fried rice. She 
gave me money. I didn&#39;t want it. She said uncle and I were two yuan. She didn&#39;t 
know that uncle was also bitter. After escorting her away, I saw that she had a 
lot of white hair and was short (I don&#39;t know why). Alas, how can I be worthy of 
her! I changed my suit, but I feel better. Really.<br>

After dinner, I looked at the geography in the classroom. It was very easy to 
remember. If only I could hurry up.<br>
<br>
At noon, Hu Cheng, Daosheng, mawenxiang and Ren Guangrong were given fried rice 
and sugar to eat. It was fun to throw them away. They scrambled. The sugar was 
very sweet. I also thought it was delicious. Hu Cheng said that it was too good 
to aftertaste.<br>

In the morning, biqingyuan and I had a small piece of sesame cake.<br>
<br>
At noon, biqingyuan and I had a chestnut.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, biqingyuan and I had a handful of multi flavored melon seeds 
(with sweet taste), a little with sunguanghai, and then with Hucheng, not to be 
affected, but also with Guanghai. It was fun.<br>
<br>
In the evening, Hucheng and I had a handful of flavored melon seeds and a half 
with wuwenhua.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0420<br>
<br>
In the evening, I played chess with sunguanghai. I had the advantage first, but 
then I lost. Be careful. However, the Second World War was defeated by Da 
Hongwei. There were mountains outside the real mountain, which was despised by 
Hu Cheng.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
I still haven&#39;t had breakfast today. I read English in the morning. The evening 
self-study class and biqingyuan talked about the first part of the class. It 
turned out that luoshouxi and Li Erqiao had some feelings, and so did I.<br>
<br>
Today, zhaotingxi talks about biqingyuan&#39;s 35 degree angle and right angle. It 
turned out that it was the second ring, but the first ring was Chenjun. Without 
saying it, I was really cold. As for Tan Derong, Wang Ling, Chen Bin, 
zhaotingxi, fengqingrong, Li Erqiao and biqingyuan, I can&#39;t teach them, but I 
know the reason.<br>
<br>

On Thursday this week, the mid-term exam began. When I went to class at noon, I 
saw a Chen Jun, who was very middle. Bibo covered his shoulders, with even 
materials, long legs and slim waist. He was well dressed and had a strong sense 
of tightness. I didn&#39;t feel flustered.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the class held a group discussion to comment on the personal 
summary, but there was nothing to talk about. I gave a section to biqingyuan and 
the girl. I really scolded him. Chen Jun smiled, but he didn&#39;t know what he 
knew.<br>

It&#39;s really nervous to review, but I&#39;m not afraid. As long as I work harder in 
English, I&#39;m very optimistic. At noon, Li Hongtao and I had to finish the exams 
of the romance of Li Zicheng and the romance of Yongchang. During the afternoon 
nap, I saw Songmin kill his wife. It was very funny. The winner was the prince 
and the loser was Kou. I didn&#39;t fall asleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0424<br>
<br>
In the morning, sun Guanghai said that Qingzhou, Xuzhou and so on. It turns out 
that President Wang once said that there are many famous cities in Jiangsu: 
Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou and so on get full marks. It&#39;s really interesting.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, a meeting was held to discuss the examination discipline and 
rank. It must be done well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning, I took the Chinese test. I felt good. I was also satisfied with 
my composition. In the afternoon, I was also very good at history. It was really 
happy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0426<br>
<br>
Today, I took the geometry test and English test. I was very satisfied with the 
geometry test, but my English was poor (I was poor in English). I had to catch 
up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0427<br>
<br>
When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t sleep after three o&#39;clock. As soon as 
I have something to do tomorrow, I wake up early. I did well in algebra. It&#39;s 
especially valuable to have a good geography test, but others just can&#39;t.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0428<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I took the political exam, which was also very good. At last 
the exam was over.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched the movie Yamaha fish stall. It was very good, full of 
life flavor and southern flavor. Aaron and Zhuzhu were really good!<br>

This afternoon, the &quot;May Day holiday&quot; began. In the afternoon, I went to the 
station. I missed my ticket. I had to buy a 4:40 ticket and waited at the 
station. Hu Cheng and I watched three-dimensional film portraits. I watched the 
scenery of Hong Kong, the Shaolin Temple and the scenery of the motherland.<br>
<br>
The bus was crowded to death. The bus was crowded with Yijun back to back. It 
was interesting.<br>
<br>
On the way home, I met my younger brother and later my father who was pushing a 
scooter to buy fertilizer. I should be ashamed. I was so sweating. It&#39;s good to 
watch &quot;chains of blood&quot; on TV in the evening, shinfu and Huizi.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0430<br>
<br>
At noon today, my uncle took me on a bike and taught me to get on and off. I 
learned from my brother yesterday. It&#39;s good. In the evening, Ju Hongcheng and 
Wang Zijiang came to play. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m also relieved.<br>

After arriving at the school this afternoon, the Taoist priest took me to public 
land 202, which is ten miles away from the city. In the east of the city, he 
said there was a big tower more than 50 meters high, so I gladly went with him. 
He can ride a bike. Unlike me, he can&#39;t. He took me with him. I can&#39;t take him 
with me.<br>
<br>
At 4:40, we set out. We were very comfortable and in a good mood. We saw the 
tower from a distance. It was really imposing.<br>
<br>
When we arrived, we first saw a radar, but we didn&#39;t understand it. We just 
watched it. When we arrived at the big tower, we walked around the tower and 
couldn&#39;t help admiring it. Later, we went to several radars, which read &quot;Nanjing 
West&quot;. Daosheng said that it was to protect the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. 
Now it&#39;s useless. When Chiang Kai Shek wanted to counter attack the mainland, he 
sent planes to shoot, but he shot two objects, a large chimney of a fertilizer 
plant and a crematorium. Because of smoke, he took the third shot, and two of 
the three planes were hit. It was really cold.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s 5:40 when I came back by bike. I&#39;m really glad to see the world.<br>

The geography test paper was handed out in the morning, 90 points, the highest.<br>
<br>
At noon, I rode with Tai Chenghua to zhaowangshan - crematorium. He also took 
me, but I also took him for a while. When we went to Zhaowang mountain, we 
walked around the cemetery for a week. We didn&#39;t know what to do. We watched the 
memorial hall under construction. It was old and new. That&#39;s nice.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to the crematorium to mainly look at the chimney. After I went 
there, there was nothing to see except that it was smoking and the next few were 
crying. Suddenly a man asked us what we were doing, and I said, &quot;look for my 
uncle.&quot; he asked me, and I answered. I said he knew his family name, Zhang. He 
asked me to come. He gave me several names. I said no, he said his family name 
was fan. I insisted that his family name was Zhang, a city man. Later, he took a 
nap, also known as a meeting, and we left. Tai Chenghua said, &quot;like a dead man&quot;, 
but he was happy enough. He was really addicted to playing.<br>

Tonight, the school held the first May 4th bonfire party. I can&#39;t say what I 
want. Zhaotingxi and qinbin borrowed clothes and didn&#39;t talk to each other. I 
went to get the car with sunguanghai, but I didn&#39;t get it, but I really went 
shopping in No. 2 middle school. They played the piano well in the kindergarten 
teachers&#39; class. At the party, there were crosstalk, solo singing, group 
dancing, and later singing and dancing. There were many programs, but they 
couldn&#39;t really see them. I often went to the front to see a girl who danced in 
the first year of high school. She was in good shape. Later, she set off 
fireworks in the experimental building. It was really amazing.<br>
<br>
After leaving, he went back to work, but he had nothing to do. He sang wine and 
coffee with Li Erqiao, which was the best song in the world. Later, he went back 
to the dormitory to recite poems.<br>

<br>
Today is another holiday, because the self-taught people are taking the 
university entrance examination in our university. I don&#39;t know if I should go 
back? But I still bought the ticket. In the evening, I watched the TV &quot;Legend of 
heroes in carving&quot; (three episodes), Guojing and huangrong.<br>
<br>

and the chain of blood (the back of Episode 6). I got a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0506<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched the chain of blood (episodes 9 and 10). Huizi and 
shinfu, Mr. Qingchuan in the play is really hateful. He causes everything. He 
smiles all over his face, but his eyes never smile.<br>

I went to school this morning. It happened that Dazhuo town was communicating, 
but there were not many things. Somehow, he became pessimistic again. When he 
arrived at school, he was at a loss and went to the street to buy a mirror comb 
and hair cream. Alas! How can you be pessimistic? Is it only that dreadful, 
unknown face, so delayed, that it is difficult to see the real man. Noon nap, 
not taste, recall the past, relatives, straight to cry, what kind of person is 
he, learning?<br>
<br>
<br>

Today, I handed out the test paper, algebra 86, English 56.5, which is really 
bad<br>

Put down the geometry book, 100 points, 98 points later, but I am also satisfied 
Chinese 83 (84) is the highest. Anyway, I&#39;m not very satisfied<br>

I finished watching the legend of the Eagle Shooting hero (Volume II) in one 
day, and I have spent any time. Chongyang immortal, Eastern evil and Western 
poison, southern emperor and Northern beggar, old playboy, Quanzhen seven sons, 
Jiangnan seven monsters, Qiu Qianren, Guojing, huangrong, Huazheng, Tuolei, 
Genghis Khan, ouyangke, Yang Kang, all heroes make people tremble. But what is 
the final result? Nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Today, I saw the movie &quot;three smiles&quot;. I thought it was amazing. After Li 
Erqiao&#39;s good words, I was eager to try. But after watching it, I didn&#39;t see it. 
What does Tangbohu want to do with Qiuxiang? Wish Zhishan, make people spit. I 
had nothing to do in the evening. I went to the Cultural Palace to watch people 
skate. Several young men had beautiful movements, and two of them danced on one 
side. Later, I watched others play chess.<br>

I was too lazy to get up in the morning (Sunday). One day I read Notre Dame de 
Paris (I didn&#39;t read it carefully). The book was ok, but the famous work that 
made Hugo famous had a great reputation, which was actually difficult to attach. 
The characters in the book are not very optimistic. It&#39;s also very good to read 
the legend of heroes in carving (Part I) in the evening self-study.<br>

In the evening, I finished watching the legend of the Eagle Shooting hero (Part 
I) in my self-study. In this way, I saw 32 episodes in 40 episodes, and the plot 
was clear.<br>
<br>
Somehow, wearing a white shirt is a little self filthy, maybe a little big. 
Yesterday, mawenxiang was surprised to find that I was a m fan. He also said 
that maybe he thought of m in his heart. Fengqingrong disagreed, but everyone 
praised himself.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I think of myself, sometimes I don&#39;t? Really how, who knows.<br>

At noon, I went to the street with Li Erqiao to find the leather shoes. If I 
didn&#39;t find them, I found three kinds of cracks and made up for them. I went 
back to my dormitory and went to bed. Suzhengyun is still playing cards every 
day. He is drunk, but what good is it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0515<br>
<br>
Wake up in the morning, 5. 25. They slept for a while and got up at 6 o&#39;clock, 
but Li Erqiao and his wife hadn&#39;t got up yet. Mr. Ji asked me why I failed the 
foreign language exam. I was shocked and said, &quot;I never did well in the exam&quot;. 
He asked me to do well and not read novels. That&#39;s really the case.<br>

At dinner, Ma Wenxiang said &quot;seven&quot; to me. It was really. The street was crowded 
with people. Most of them bought clothes, but they couldn&#39;t. later, they spent 
one yuan on shorts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0517<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, Mr. Ji announced the mid-term exam. I can&#39;t believe he Yan 
told his grandmother&#39;s parents and relatives, but there are still others behind, 
right.<br>
<br>
This time English is poor, but politics (72) is unexpected.<br>

<br>
I feel like learning English today. I used to hate this, but now, there is still 
a year to go. What are you afraid of?<br>
<br>
I took a nap at noon and forgot the time. I didn&#39;t know when the bell rang. When 
biqingyuan left, he suddenly found that I was fragrant! He woke up and scolded 
me. When I looked at my watch, it was bad. I hurried to work. It was a close 
call.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the reading room.<br>
<br>
<br>

Today, biqingyuan treated me to the movie &quot;a Hun Xin Zhuan&quot;, which made me laugh 
the most.<br>

The new biography of ah Hun, which was arranged by the school, still laughed 
badly.<br>
<br>
The next night, self-study and wuwenhua went to the advanced education school to 
watch TV. At 11 o&#39;clock, they didn&#39;t know what the problem was. The one armed 
man killed nine sons of Chumen. Chu nine sons, their sons and daughters were 
killing like a plague. Later, Xiujin closed the door, was scolded, and Fang went 
back to school.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
A school meeting was held in the afternoon to discuss the mid-term exam. What 
can I do? It will continue tomorrow.<br>

After reading the Shangying pictorial today, I felt like I was breaking out.<br>
<br>
I went to the library in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0523<br>
<br>
Su Zhengyun took a &quot;beauty picture&quot; of Hu Cheng (Zhang Yu and Liu Xiaoqing took 
a group photo in the Shangying pictorial). Hu Cheng asked Su Zhengyun to buy 100 
soft candies, but Su Zhengyun bought them. It&#39;s funny. Of course we ate them on 
the spot.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Hucheng and fengqingrong made a bet on two bags of melon seeds, saying nonsense, 
&quot;Liang Shuli told him the secret between Liang and Feng. Feng didn&#39;t believe it, 
but Liang confronted him. Feng had to buy it. It seems that friends can&#39;t be 
enough friends.&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
I washed my clothes at noon. I won&#39;t go back today because I have Monday class 
tomorrow (July). Decided to go back tomorrow. In the evening, I read the legend 
of the Eagle Shooting hero (Episode II), which is the best martial arts novel in 
the world. Mu Nianci really doesn&#39;t understand Yang Kang.<br>

There will be no holiday tomorrow. Because it rains on Monday, teachers will not 
go to the countryside to investigate and go to high school. But I ran out of 
ammunition and food, so I had to borrow it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0527 (I)<br>
<br>
It&#39;s hard to borrow money. They say they don&#39;t. Borrowed four jiao from 
mawenxiang. So is da Hongwei. Teacher Fei commented on the composition and said 
that my writing was a little Lu Xun like. You know, it was the greatest 
encouragement to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0528 (II)<br>
<br>
I suddenly decided to have a holiday tomorrow. I&#39;m really unprepared. It was fun 
today. Da Hongwei borrowed food tickets from me. I borrowed some from liyouwen. 
In the afternoon, I went back to my family (2). Although it was (7), I could 
only say (2), let alone (2).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0529 (III)<br>
<br>
This morning, I steamed a chicken (little cock) at home. Although it was not 
delicious, I was still very grateful. My family only said I was thin, alas.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched TV. The Chinese team played against the Cuban team 
(women&#39;s volleyball team). The Chinese team won 3-2, but the Cuban team couldn&#39;t 
see it. It was really good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0530 (IV)<br>
<br>
I went to the street to get my watch today, because I went to change it 
yesterday. My younger brother picked up a diamond card and replaced the old Gem 
Flower. In fact, it was a Zhongshan watch. It was a steal. The watch is much 
better. It looks like a new one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0531 (V)<br>
<br>
Today, I beat Chen Bin 1:0 and Daosheng 2:0 in chess, but I lost mawenxiang and 
didn&#39;t take a nap. It seems that there will be a day in the sky.<br>
<br>

Tonight, I went to the power supply bureau with Ma Wenxiang to watch the TV 
&quot;heroes of carving&quot; (Episode IV).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0602 (VII)<br>
<br>
In the morning, I went to the power supply bureau with Ma Wenxiang to watch TV, 
&quot;Legend of heroes in carving&quot; (four episodes). It&#39;s over. In fact, the benefits 
are not shallow. Genghis Khan laid down so many territories that, as Guo Jing 
said, he was buried only six feet away. Ouyangfeng said, &quot;who am I?&quot; Just as Guo 
Jing said, &quot;we don&#39;t know who we are.&quot; I didn&#39;t have lunch and bought some fried 
dough twist to satisfy my hunger. I ate eight Liang for the first time in the 
evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0603 (I)<br>
<br>
Today&#39;s school film &quot;black tulip&quot; is adapted from Dumas&#39; novel. &quot;I am me&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0604 (II)<br>
<br>
Coincidentally, I saw Mrs. Thatcher today: &quot;I am who I am.&quot; today, I really 
wanted to go forward. It was bright, but I was.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0605 (III)<br>
<br>
Look at the youth digest. It is &quot;I am me&quot; again.<br>
<br>
It must be believed.<br>

In recent days, chess has flourished, and chess skills have increased. He has 
taken over with Da Hongwei, Hu Cheng and sun Guanghai. He has suffered from a 
disastrous defeat, but he has remained flat for a long time. You should learn 
something. He defeated Hu Cheng the night before yesterday and Da Hongwei 
tonight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
0607 (V)<br>
<br>
At noon, Da Hongwei was defeated in one game, and he was defeated after school. 
After the evening self-study, he fought with Hu Cheng until 11 o&#39;clock, and 
defeated him in the last game after several setbacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0608 (VI)<br>
<br>
In the evening, I studied by myself and played chess with Taoist students in the 
class. When the light went out, I looked for a candle. After more than 1:00 
p.m., when I arrived in the dormitory, someone played cards and still lit a 
candle. After sleeping for a while, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I played another chess 
game with Hu Cheng. It was nearly 3 o&#39;clock, so I dared to sleep tight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0609 (VII)<br>
<br>
It was more than 8 o&#39;clock when they woke up, but they were still very sleepy 
and weak, and they played an all night card.<br>
<br>
At noon, I played chess with mawenxiang and couldn&#39;t sleep. In the evening, I 
didn&#39;t go to self-study. After playing chess with Hu Cheng, I went to sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0610 (I)<br>
<br>
Today, I cleaned the cleaning area again. It&#39;s really troublesome. I don&#39;t want 
to clean it anymore. After dinner, for fear of being scolded by Mr. Ji, he 
forced Li Erqiao and Da Hongwei to go. He went to the dormitory to take a bath 
and change clothes.<br>

<br>
After the geography paper was put down, I was 84, which was also high. In a 
word, it was OK in the eyes of Guan Xiaotang. He changed me. Many students 
changed it. So no matter 70, 80 or 60, they called me less. Qin bin was angry 
and scolded. Qin bin was 63. He was so angry that he hit the teacher hard and 
changed it by 70 points. Didn&#39;t that hurt the students&#39; feelings?<br>
<br>
It is a big reason to change the paper strictly, but why do those who are 
deducted so care about it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0612 (III)<br>
<br>
Mawenxiang said that I cried when I lost my chess. It really annoyed me. 
Sunguanghai lent me a bad chess, and he also borrowed it. Later, due to the 
conflict between Hu Cheng and Da Hongwei, he was thrown into the corridor by Su 
Zhengyun, picked up by the dormitory of the royal mausoleum, and then thrown 
away by them. Of course, I looked for it after it was lost.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to bed first. Li Erqiao wanted to talk to me. I wanted to 
play, so I didn&#39;t speak. Ma Wenxiang said the next day that I was crying. I 
disdained to argue, but Hu Cheng believed it, and so did Su Zhengyun. He said to 
sun Guanghai, &quot;for chess, he was crying.&quot; I was so angry that I asked Ma if he 
heard it. He said he heard it. I said, &quot;the dirty man is innocent.&quot; I swore not 
to speak to him. Now he is all right. In my bed, I asked him to go and made an 
agreement with him. It&#39;s interesting that if he doesn&#39;t speak tomorrow, he can 
make a good agreement.<br>

The relationship between Hu Cheng and me is getting better and better. Due to 
chess, he is really close. His skills are superb. I am convinced to learn and 
make great progress. He likes to play with me, and I prefer to play with him.<br>
<br>
I washed my clothes today. I&#39;m so happy. I had a big worry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0614 (V)<br>
<br>
Today I played chess and killed the whole world. At noon, I had a set with Wang 
Feng and a set with Daosheng, winning and losing. In the afternoon, Cui Hui 
played two sets. He was helped by others. He lost two sets and won one set with 
Da Hongwei.<br>
<br>
Before the evening self-study, I won two sets of Taoist students. I understand 
that my skills have greatly increased, but I still need to work hard. Is there 
no end to learning? If you want to kill them, you must study them.<br>
<br>

After English class in the afternoon, I played chess with Taoist. I also played 
one game after another during dinner. 4:--10: after the evening self-study, I 
killed two more games in the dormitory. He lost more. It was very interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0616 (VII)<br>
<br>
It was more than seven o&#39;clock when I woke up in the morning. I slept until 
eight o&#39;clock and got up for a while. After that, I slept until lunch. After 
that, I simply recited the song of everlasting regret and paced back and forth 
in the dormitory. I was so happy. Then I slept until three o&#39;clock.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Time is merciless, day after day, what do you know? I can&#39;t help but ask myself, 
what is the foundation of the great cause? What is the concept of the Chinese 
Department of Peking University and who am I? If you don&#39;t learn English 
quickly, what&#39;s wrong with being a layman? &quot;The kind face often smiles, laughing 
at the ridiculous people in the world&quot;! I am me.<br>

A day has passed and nothing has been done. Who am I?<br>
<br>
Today, I suddenly had nothing to say with Hu chengge. In the evening, I resumed 
my relationship with biqingyuan. I was like a friend who had been away for a 
long time. There were so many words. What?<br>
<br>
Today, I made a big joke. I wrote something:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sister Teresa Teng, a super world singer, was born on the 14th day of the 
twelfth lunar month (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true. Anyway, the Gregorian calendar 
is on January 28). Ge Di Yimin, a scholar named Jurong, was born on the 14th day 
of the twelfth lunar month (it&#39;s true). When Li Jun returned to the mainland, 
min paid tribute to Yi with his son of the same birthday. Yi laughed, and min 
laughed, so she became a rebel and made a golden orchid. He was a big sister and 
min Ci was a younger brother. For a while, it was said that it was (laughter) a 
good talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ten comments from students:<br>
<br>
Li Erqiao&#39;s Pravda: whoo! Climbing the dragon and attaching the Phoenix, you can 
see the whole leopard! The heart of the world, the heart of the people! Pathetic 
Hoo! Huang Mei and Li Sheng commented that this is the strange current situation 
of today&#39;s society!<br>
<br>
Biqingyuan&#39;s Wen Wei Po: sad husband, arrogant, dream? They are all empty 
shadows, and their positions are low and lowly. How can we make love with your 
honor? However, I don&#39;t have to sigh too much. The future will be long, the 
earth will be safe and the people will be long, the fame will last for a 
lifetime, and the road will be hard. I hope you can reach the green clouds.<br>
<br>
Tao Sheng&#39;s weekly review: Ho Ho, Ge Zhe, who is originally an animal, wants to 
climb higher and become brother and sister with stars. He is an asshole. He 
dreams and is in the daytime. It is really sad, pathetic and pathetic.<br>
<br>
Cuihui&#39;s Xinmin Evening News: come overseas to find bosom friends and dream.<br>
<br>
Fengqingrong&#39;s evening news: it&#39;s strange that a &quot;Ge&quot; can&#39;t dare to climb high. 
What kind of marriage is just a fantasy.<br>
<br>
Li Erqiao&#39;s Chao daily (second review):?!<br>
<br>
Hua tinggan, RI Daily: Comrade Yimin is not a Jurong scholar because he doesn&#39;t 
work hard and leads a good relationship. In my opinion, he is called a &quot;plain 
student&quot; or &quot;mediocre student&quot;.<br>
<br>
Cui Hui&#39;s &quot;Xinming Evening News&quot; (second review): as the saying goes: the Dragon 
climbs the dragon, and the Phoenix is attached to the Phoenix. Can you be called 
a dragon? Or Phoenix?<br>
<br>
Fengqingrong&#39;s daily review (second review): if one review is not enough, let&#39;s 
review again. Cream scholar, waste my pen and ink. It&#39;s not worth a review!<br>

Hua tinggan&#39;s free essay Tan (second review): it&#39;s nothing to mention being a

What a lethargy! What have you done these days? Mawenxiang defiled his innocence 
and broke up with him. Hu Cheng, when I said his shortcomings, he scolded me, 
ignored me and broke up with me. Li Erqiao said behind his back that he was 
pitiful. What a good word! He broke up his friendship. How did biqingyuan do it? 
He spoke ill of people behind their backs. I said he was horrible and dirty. He 
broke up with me. It&#39;s amazing! Tao is the antithesis of heaven. I&#39;m lonely and 
small. I&#39;m so poor. Is it true that I have been fantasizing about this for 
almost three months.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0620 (IV)<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, we went to the dormitory to take a bath with Taoist. We washed 
in the bathroom and washed ourselves with tap water. It was very interesting. 
Changed clothes. Before the evening self-study, I walked around the city with 
Taoist students for a long time. He said that I was more handsome than before. 
So did old ma.<br>
<br>
During the evening self-study, I had a whole talk with suzhengyun. He told me a 
lot of truth. I couldn&#39;t help feeling that he was cute. Only then did I know 
that to understand a person, I must get along with him. He said that he has many 
friends, but I have few. If I want to make friends, I must have the same 
character and be good with me. Who can do it? Let&#39;s talk about it later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0621 (V)<br>
<br>
Today, I took a nap and thought about the theme song &quot;thank you&quot; of &quot;blood 
suspicion&quot;. I couldn&#39;t sleep. What a tearful song.<br>
<br>
In the evening, they talked about tangjinghua, who was admitted to the youth 
class of Nanjing University. I was speechless. I swear &quot;north, foreign affairs, 
promise, society, one&quot;. Who understands.<br>

I was going to go home, but I didn&#39;t go back because I had a political exam in 
the afternoon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0623 (VII)<br>
<br>
I got up early in the morning and prepared to go back. I took the 7:50 bus and 
ate three zongzi at home. I played chess with Yicheng. Alas, I don&#39;t know what 
to do. My mother said that my parents didn&#39;t eat at my place, but it&#39;s my fault. 
My mother said that after eating (I&#39;m afraid of being annoyed), my father left 
the second class and waited until twoo&#39;clock. I don&#39;t know, but later, in the 
future, I believe in myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0624 (I)<br>
<br>
I got up early this morning. I ate three eggs and three dumplings when I got 
back to school. It was very cold. My family asked me to wear clothes, but I 
refused. They were better than me. I was in plain clothes. What happened? Is 
there anything wrong with my family?<br>
<br>
This afternoon, I slept in the morning of my class. When I fell asleep, I became 
cold. In the afternoon, I dragged on my history class. I wanted to vomit, but I 
had to endure it. After class, I went to the dormitory. I vomited at the 
entrance of the stairs at school, and went down again. When I went to the 
dormitory, I vomited violently in the toilet. How uncomfortable it was. I went 
back to the dormitory and covered the quilt. Alas, where are my relatives and 
career! I couldn&#39;t study by myself at night. I turned the window and went into 
the dormitory, covered my head and slept.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The final exam is coming soon, so I will naturally enter the tense review. It&#39;s 
so annoying. You can&#39;t stop. Take care of yourself.<br>

After a nap, I woke up in a sweat. I must have recovered from my illness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0627 (IV)<br>
<br>
I went to see the movie &quot;the prodigal son Yanqing&quot; tonight. I, Daosheng and Li 
Erqiao went there. I bought tickets and Li Erqiao bought ice cream. In this way, 
the relationship between me and Li Erqiao was normalized again, but I was a 
little embarrassed at first. I don&#39;t know how I got along with Ma Wenxiang. He 
and I slept in my bed at noon. I&#39;m also very happy. What is the bond in the 
world?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0628 (V)<br>
<br>
I must be right to my family. What will I do when I grow up? I hope I can 
fantasize.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
This morning, my aunt sent rice and forced me to pay more than four yuan.<br>
<br>
The final exam will begin tomorrow, and this is the end of Nichi!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: due to the busy study in senior three, I have no time to write my diary in 
order to cope with the top priority of the college entrance examination. I say 
sorry to myself. I know I will stop for one year! Sorry, sorry! Forgive 
yourself.<br>

The college entrance examination will be held tomorrow. It&#39;s really so-called &quot;I 
don&#39;t know when the big pain is coming&quot;. It&#39;s not unusual. I wish I had taken 
the exam earlier. I was amazed that there were still more than 20 days left. It 
can be seen that I was tired of fighting and wanted to fight. Review these days, 
night to 12 o&#39;clock, 1 o&#39;clock, bitter! During the afternoon meeting, my uncle 
came to me and gave me two melons. In the evening, I couldn&#39;t review. I went to 
watch the video &quot;divine eagle heroes&quot; (21, 22) with Li Erqiao. Yang Guo and Xiao 
Longnv are really enviable. I bought tickets for &quot;a thousand miles of black 
colt&quot; and didn&#39;t dare to watch it. After coming back, I was a little excited and 
couldn&#39;t sleep, so I had to sit and torture myself, repeating it twice and 
falling asleep at one o&#39;clock.<br>

The great college entrance examination has begun. In the morning, Chinese and 
geography have been passed smoothly, and the examination papers are easy. Pinyin 
3 points. After reading Longtou and qinbin, auspicious people have their own 
heaven. I slept well tonight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0708<br>
<br>
In today&#39;s math and English exams, I failed to work out one and a half math 
questions, but so did others. It doesn&#39;t matter. I got a good English test (I 
think) and God helps me too! Terrible sentence pattern conversion, collocation 
did not test, but reading comprehension accounted for 30 points, good!<br>
<br>
In the past, I asked luozhihua to copy for me. When I was late, I went to the 
street to eat dumplings. He broke the money (1.5 yuan). I was very upset. I kept 
trying to report. I invited him today. Two people eat dumplings at home. It 
seems that they have arrived at their own home. It&#39;s very enjoyable. Four bowls 
(two yuan and twenty-eight cents). Hell, but they are very happy.<br>
<br>
I am very upset tonight. It wasn&#39;t until three o&#39;clock that I fell asleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0709<br>
<br>
Such a great college entrance examination has passed. It has been successful in 
history and politics.<br>
<br>
My brother came by tractor to carry things for me. I gave him everything. There 
were a lot of things. Mr. Fu originally asked me to wait for him at 7:30. He 
wanted to rewrite a summary for me and discussed to photocopy the award 
certificate tomorrow morning so that it could be sent to Nantah. Thank him very 
much. But before 7:50, I probably had something to do, so I watched the videos 
&quot;the divine eagle Xialv&quot; (25, 26) and &quot;the woman being followed&quot; with Erqiao. I 
was very happy.<br>
<br>
When he came back, he bought melon seeds to eat. Luoshouxi was very upset about 
his money. Playing cards until four o&#39;clock, I went to Dai Zhaofang&#39;s bed 
because of mosquito nails. I slept alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0710<br>
<br>
When I got up today, I waited for Mr. Fu. He said he would wait for him at 9 
o&#39;clock (he came last night at 9 o&#39;clock and asked my roommate because I was 
away). He also waited for Mrs. Xi to turn over the key and take back the money. 
Later, when I came, I rewritten the summary at Mr. Fu&#39;s office. He wrote and I 
copied it. It was really difficult for him.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hou Ji came again and wrote the head teacher&#39;s opinion, which was very good. 
Later, I went to the county government with Mr. Fu and zhengrenxiang to make 
copies. Zhengrenxiang and I had a strange feeling, like a pair of men and women 
on TV. You know, I never had this opportunity. Maybe in the future.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy Pushkin&#39;s Lyric Poems (Part 2) and 
the collection of four people, and then I took the bus home.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0717<br>
<br>
I have been watching TV for a few days. There are fewer Hong Kong films and none 
in Japan. The rise of &quot;railway guerrillas&quot; and the like is pure nonsense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0723<br>
<br>
It&#39;s really hard. It&#39;s only been more than ten days. It seems that after a 
century, it&#39;s hard to wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0728<br>
<br>
This afternoon, I was watching Red and black. Suddenly, I asked loudly, &quot;is 
Yimin at home?&quot;, After a few questions, my brother went out, and I immediately 
thought of the college entrance examination scores. Sure enough, as soon as I 
went out, I saw dingzhuoran, sweating, and told me, &quot;I know your score, and I 
told you 532&quot;. I immediately became happy and smiled. He went to see XURUI. 
XURUI told him that he was big enough to be recommended. The whole dormitory was 
talking about me.<br>
<br>
Mom was happy too. After a while, my aunt came.<br>
<br>
532, the third in the county, with a maximum of 534.<br>
<br>
Thank God!<br>
<br>
So I decided to look at it clearly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0729<br>
<br>
This morning, I went to see the score. I took the tractor of Genbao Murakami and 
saw teachers wangyinquan, wangrongpei, jiyanggen, fushaozeng and fanxianglin. 
They all said that I did well in the exam. NTU only waited for notice. Zhuning 
534, zhengrenxiang 533, I 532, Hua Ping 524, Tan Derong 516, Qin Bing 506, Li 
Erqiao 454, mawenxiang 422, Tang Ping 483, lijinlin 480. They didn&#39;t do well in 
the exam. I&#39;m really sad for them. If it were for me, I would be dead.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I listened to the radio. The first batch of liberal arts 
students were 517, and the second batch of liberal arts students were 538, and 
the second batch of liberal arts students were 506, and the first batch of 
liberal arts students were 518. I got 15 points more than the first batch, and I 
said hello. I&#39;m really relieved. That night, Dad wrote to his brother.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0815<br>
<br>
Forget it, this summer vacation, wait, wait, wait.<br>
<br>
Wait for grade, wait for notice (Chinese Department of Nanjing University), wait 
for school.<br>
<br>
When they came, they were glad, glad, glad again.<br>
<br>
Go to dinner, go to friends and relatives, treat people to sugar.<br>
<br>
Forget it, go to the University!<br>

<br>
High school literature (I)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Great Wall Fu<br>
<br>
Alas, the Great Wall is so magnificent that it startles the sky. The ground 
connects Qin and Yan, and the north is blocked by the north wind. You are 2800 
years old, and things are 10000 miles long. The giant dragon sleeps on the 
ground and the lion lies on the ground, which can make the Han Wei powerful. The 
Han family suffered many difficulties, and then you stood up and chided the 
north wind. In the north, it&#39;s impossible for people to live in the past. Only 
in the South can we be worried about impermanence. The first emperor of Qin 
unified and connected with the emperor. Later, the emperor looked at the history 
of the Qing Dynasty. The Han family has a good land, three emperors, five 
emperors and two empresses dowagers. The world is full of troubles. People 
pretend that you know it. Ask you how the Ming River and mountains are. It&#39;s so 
peaceful in the 400 spring and Autumn period. But there has been no peace since 
ancient times, and too much peace always brings trouble. Once the king rides, he 
meets the king and worries about the Mingshan mountain.<br>
<br>
The greatness of the Great Wall startles the sky and makes people shut their 
mouths when they see it. Thousands of miles of empty mountains and smoke, the 
ancient pines are empty. High in the forest, the autumn wind rises, and the 
dangerous mountains and deep ditches mourn the sound of insects. It is as strong 
as this. Ho Fu, you can&#39;t see all the people from afar, but you can go farther 
and reach forward. The new wind is blowing in. You have been humiliated. I am 
ashamed of it. The latter invades the great wall and destroys it. Thousands of 
people are in trouble. One person celebrates the disaster. The foreign aggressor 
Hu Wei kills people like a hemp. The sleeping lion never wakes up, and the 
Dragon covers the ground forever. The greatness of the Great Wall startles the 
sky. I can&#39;t bear to look up and ask you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Hillside sheep Watching &quot;burning the Old Summer Palace&quot;<br>
<br>
The officials were far away, the coalition forces were rampant, and the people 
ran in panic. Looking at the ancient capital, my heart hesitates, and I am sad 
about the business office for a hundred years,<br>
<br>
All the palaces and palaces were on fire. Garden, made soil; Country, make soil!<br>
<br>
Night rise<br>
<br>
Close the door and push the window to listen to the Jiayu, turn off the lamp to 
sleep and smell the sound of insects. The ups and downs of life have returned, 
and there is no future in the dark.<br>
<br>
Self question<br>
<br>
The vicissitudes of life have gone through many hardships, and the world will 
never forget moving words. The east wind has passed away, and the fate of 
Cangshan is half done.<br>
<br>
Beauty Yu<br>
<br>
It&#39;s hard to say goodbye when we meet. Today I&#39;m sad and heartbroken. Your eyes 
are full of tears. You should know that the Cowherd and the weaver girl laugh at 
us.<br>
<br>
Ask you who is difficult in everything, but you are the only one who is 
difficult. I can&#39;t bear to see the wet skirt with tears on my face. I don&#39;t know 
that my tears are still full.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Hui Wenlian:<br>
<br>
The mountains are cold, the water is cold, and the autumn wind is evil<br>
<br>
Empty pot warms wine, beauty mourns<br>
<br>
The wind blows in the autumn, the water is cold and the mountains are far away<br>
<br>
The pot of wine is empty.<br>

<br>
There were two well-dressed men on the bus. The crowd said this was the 
Transportation Bureau<br>
<br>
The bus still wants to open when it passes the station. An old woman climbs the 
door of the bus and the conductor says that it costs 10 cents a station<br>

5. When Secretary Zhao goes to the countryside, he often comes back to see his 
mother full of ghosts. He doesn&#39;t take a needle from the masses<br>
<br>
Director Qian&#39;s cupboards are always full when he divides rooms. What&#39;s your 
mother&#39;s song about being selfless and not greedy<br>
<br>
Director Sun called for workers and opened the back door again and again. What 
did your ancestors preach about killing relatives for righteousness and treating 
them equally<br>
<br>
Section chief Li visits the official and civilian parents who boast about their 
parents for eight generations.<br>

7. Three poems<br>
<br>
When a child who has just learned how to count counts one, two or three, a poem 
comes into being.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not a poet, of course I can&#39;t write poetry, but I still don&#39;t understand:<br>
<br>
Why is there only three talents in this world? Why are they the beginning of all 
things? Doesn&#39;t it mean that life produces two, two produces three, and three 
produces all things? Only three can increase and develop?<br>
<br>
Our motherland has always had a long history. Why are there only three emperors? 
Suiren drills fire, and fire symbolizes the sun, which is called the emperor; 
Fuxi&#39;s traveling to the world is called the emperor of man; Shennong reclaims 
land, which is called the earth emperor. Is there another emperor? No. Why? I 
don&#39;t know<br>
<br>
Why do people only have three lights, the sun, the moon and the stars? Only they 
can give people light, hope and undying enthusiasm. Why did only three 
generations of Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties have the right to represent our 
slave civilization?<br>
<br>
Our motherland has always been a land of propriety and righteousness, but what 
does this have to do with San? There are so many allusions about San. Duke Huan 
welcomed Guan Zhong in three baths and three banks, and Chonger retired three 
times to report to the king. Isn&#39;t Xuande Gong also a crouching dragon? Why did 
the ancients make three concessions? Why does it take three bows to show real 
respect? Why does it take three knocks to get the host&#39;s permission? Even before 
the ancient people executed, the soul chasing cannon had to be fired three 
times?<br>
<br>
People say it&#39;s only three things, but why? ZHUJIAZHUANG must be defeated three 
times, and gaotaiwei must be defeated three times. Why the three kingdoms are 
not Three Kingdoms? Does zhougongjin want to die with three Qi?<br>
<br>
Why? I don&#39;t understand.<br>
<br>
A few years ago, there were three words on the wall and on the factory board? 
They are &quot;workers, peasants and soldiers&quot; who are precocious. Only they can 
represent the people of our country.<br>
<br>
Why do the national leaders propose to promote the three major balls while there 
are many ball games in the sports world.<br>
<br>
When people try hard, they don&#39;t count one, two or three, so one thing is 
finished. Why don&#39;t they count four?<br>
<br>
Why are there left, middle, right, upper, middle and lower, front, middle and 
rear?<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t understand.<br>
<br>
Oh, so three is the beginning of all things. It is a real poem.<br>

2. My mother<br>
<br>
Only maternal love is the greatest in the world, which leads to many mother&#39;s 
hymns. &quot;Meng&#39;s neighbor&quot; and &quot;mother-in-law stabbed&quot;. I also want to praise my 
mother. However, my mother is a genuine rural woman. She was born in the village 
and married in the village. She is 1.6 meters tall, with a round and slightly 
fat face. There are several silver threads on her black hair. The corners of her 
mouth always have a kind smile. She just finished her height and then dropped 
out of school and went home to work. I have to admit bitterly: &quot;my mother is 
ordinary.&quot;<br>
<br>
But I still want to praise my mother, just because she is my mother, not someone 
said: &quot;just because my mother gave birth to my pain, I will never repay her.&quot; I 
was born on the 14th night of the twelfth lunar month, when I was the coldest. 
My mother paid double the pain of people, and I should repay her double the pain 
of people.<br>
<br>
I want to write hymns, but I am not a poet. I only rely on a few memories to 
express all my love for my mother.<br>
<br>
Every mother loves her children very much. This mother&#39;s love is selfish and 
seems to be animal. I remember that when I was just in primary school, after 
school, for some unknown reason, several female students surrounded me and 
fought. Of course, I suffered a loss and my face was broken. After my mother 
knew it, she took me to the girls&#39; homes at night to complain, not because she 
wanted to quarrel with others, but because she loved me. Later, they laughed and 
talked to each other, but I was never beaten by them again.<br>
<br>
I remember one time, my mother came home from work and asked me to pour water 
for her, but when I was carrying a bowl and was about to get close to her, 
suddenly the bowl broke on the ground, and I burst into tears. Unexpectedly, she 
did not scold me, but said it was OK.<br>
<br>
During busy hours, the team worked at night. Every time we got a good meal, my 
mother woke us up to eat together. Once I ate, but the next morning I said I 
didn&#39;t eat, which made my mother laugh and cry.<br>
<br>
My mother always gets up very early. She wants to cook breakfast. I remember 
that once my mother woke up and I woke up. She said she wanted to sleep a little 
longer. I said, &quot;let me get up. I don&#39;t want to sleep. You can sleep for a 
while!&quot; At that time, how I wanted to replace my mother. She was too tired.<br>
<br>
My mother is also a very kind person. Once a little girl who collected eggs in a 
village was bitten by a dog, and her leg bled. Seeing this, my mother 
immediately ran home and applied Yunnan Baiyao to her, causing my grandmother to 
say she was not. Although I think my mother did the right thing, I also think 
grandma&#39;s words are reasonable. My mother had also made a lot of efforts for a 
young man in the village, but the marriage was not successful.<br>
<br>
My mother was very filial to my grandmother. Once my grandmother was 
hospitalized and couldn&#39;t eat. My mother specially made dumplings for her to 
eat. My roommate also praised my mother.<br>
<br>
My mother also beat and scolded me, or punished me for doing things. Once when I 
played with my brother&#39;s hat, my great grandfather stopped me, but I wouldn&#39;t 
let him. He said otherwise, he would throw the hat outside. Because I was my 
brother&#39;s hat, I wasn&#39;t afraid of him. If he did, my mother thought I had lost 
it, so she scolded me, and I cried miserably. Later, she knew that it was my 
great grandfather who had lost it, so she begged me for mercy. At this time, I 
felt it was my fault, so I gave up.<br>
<br>
One night, my mother went to the pond to wash clothes. I went to shine a 
flashlight. She suddenly asked me if I was good to her when I grew up? 
Henpecked? I couldn&#39;t answer at that time. Although I was thinking about how to 
honor her and earn money for her when I grew up, it was too far away. I didn&#39;t 
like how to blow it first, but I made a mistake. She wanted comfort at that 
time.<br>
<br>
My mother gave me a lot of emotions, either love or hate, or joy or anger, or 
sorrow or joy, or beating or scolding. Maybe this constitutes all maternal love.<br>
<br>
My mother is ordinary. Speaking of my mother, I don&#39;t have any tall image and 
character in front of me. I only think of a woman who is 1.6 meters tall, with a 
round and slightly fat face, her ears full of black hair but with a few silver 
threads on it, and her mouth always has a kind smile. I love her and praise her 
because she is a real mother.<br>

6. Sugar, sweet, bitter<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;There are bitter sweets in the world. Who eats them? I&#39;m kidding.&quot; Oh, dear 
reader, don&#39;t get angry. Let me plead and let me tell you a true story.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was an afternoon when I was reading at home. My father stepped into the door 
excitedly and gave me a handful of sugar. I&#39;m no longer a child. But after a 
while, I knew that something small had happened in the village. It had spread in 
the village and everyone knew it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That afternoon, several women in the village were working in the field near the 
road. It was a quiet place with few pedestrians. Suddenly, a sack full of things 
fell from a moving tractor. The driver didn&#39;t notice it. There was no pedestrian 
on the road. Just a woman found it and greeted it for a while. After a while, 
several women came to the road. Everyone was stunned for a while. A woman went 
to unpack the bag and suddenly found it was a bag of candy. She shouted. Then 
several women rushed up. Some quickly took the bag and put it in, and some took 
off their clothes and bags. After a while, they were all divided up, so they 
rushed back to the village happily. Of course, I met several people in the 
village, so everyone got one, which was quite a lot. But everyone thought that 
since they were outsiders, they would share it. But those women refused. Now 
they are their own, so they are worth cherishing. My father asked for one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My brother and I consumed the sugar in a short time. My family was calm again, 
as if nothing had happened. It doesn&#39;t seem to have much effect on my family.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the evening, I was reading a book. My great grandfather accompanied me and my 
brother. Suddenly, grandma Zhang, a neighbor, came in and held a bunch of 
sweets. We all knew that she would let us eat. My great grandfather smiled and 
said, &quot;I am not happy when I eat this food. Although it is sweet, my heart is 
bitter.&quot; Of course, my brother and I don&#39;t care. Anyway, it&#39;s sweet in our 
mouth. What&#39;s the bitterness? She also scolded her daughter-in-law and said, 
&quot;I&#39;m really a money fan. I also said that if I sold it in town, I wouldn&#39;t be 
afraid of being laughed at. I didn&#39;t approve of her.&quot;. It turned out that her 
daughter-in-law got candy and wanted to change money. My great grandfather never 
ate the candy. Instead, grandma Zhang ate a few by herself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The whole village was excited because everyone got more or less benefits, but 
what about the sugar man? How worried he would be. How unlucky, it seems that 
everyone didn&#39;t think of it. At most, they said, &quot;you deserve it. Who doesn&#39;t 
tell him to put it away.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sugar is sweet. It is made of sweet sugarcane. It is sweet in the mouth and 
sweet in the heart. However, today, when I think about it, my nose can&#39;t help 
being sour. It seems that my mouth is really bitter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So I knew that the sugar was bitter, and my great grandfather was right, but how 
could grandma Zhang, her daughter-in-law, my father, me and my brother not find 
out?<br>
<br>
<br>

Chapter 39<br>
<br>
（5） . Nanjing University (I)<br>
<br>
1. The Department of Chinese studies, Nanjing University, does not study hard, 
but tries to break into the society. During that time, when I went to Nanjing 
Jinling Theological Seminary, I heard the names of my brothers and sisters. I 
felt fascinated and heartbroken. When I graduated, I wrote in the message book 
that I believed in Christianity. At the class graduation party, when one person 
said something, I suddenly said, &quot;God bless us!&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. I read a lot of novels and wrote papers on contemporary drama, Wang Shuo&#39;s 
films and a dream of Red Mansions.<br>
<br>
3. They began to associate with a lot of girls, including students from other 
departments and schools, and students from other schools. They were too busy, 
such as dongjingping, Jiang Xuezhang, Guan Yu, Cao Lei, Wu Shujing, xuhaiying, 
Zhu Ting, Zhou Jing, and so on. Han Qinfen, a traditional Chinese medicine 
doctor in southern China, is very fond of her gentleness and gentleness. This is 
my second true love. Unfortunately, I still fell in love secretly. I once 
confessed to her. She said there was a reason, but I wouldn&#39;t let her say it. I 
said that the first feeling was right, and then I asked her to say the reason. 
She didn&#39;t say it.<br>
<br>
4. In the later stage of college, he mixed with a large number of hooligans in 
the society. In fact, they were also very good. They also paid tribute to a 
master to learn magic, Lizi card and Minghuang. Learn some Jianghu expressions 
and go through a period of Jianghu life.<br>
<br>
5. I have done a lot of business, but I don&#39;t have this kind of material because 
of my kindness.<br>
<br>
6. Other departments and schools have made many friends, such as brother road 
army.<br>
<br>
7. I helped with my friend gaoniu B, served noodles and fried vegetables to the 
guests.<br>
<br>
8. Learn go, bridge and dance. Many girls from other departments and schools 
come to my dormitory to play.<br>
<br>
9. I got to know many American and Canadian students, mainly female students, 
including Louisa Gao and carina Fei.<br>
<br>
10. I once rode a bicycle back to Jurong&#39;s hometown from Nanjing. I didn&#39;t know 
how to be brave. In order to save energy, I held a tractor in one hand and 
suddenly crossed a big slope. I even turned the car and people over to the other 
side of the road. When I woke up, a truck stopped in front of me. I got up and 
rode again. Nothing happened. It was just the opposite direction. When I found 
that the scene was familiar, I asked passers-by again and said that the 
direction was the opposite. I reversed my direction and rode back. Now I think 
this is definitely the care of God.<br>
<br>
11. Once in a film class, the teacher brought a camera. I wore a red shirt. Many 
students played close-up shots of me. The teacher said that the red dress must 
be an important person.<br>
<br>
22. I forgot how many prizes I won in the Chinese Department quiz. The prize was 
given to the fellow zhengrenxiang.<br>
<br>
23. One night, I was walking with gaobaoling on Qingdao Road next to the school. 
When talking about the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, I said that 
China had won. She said, &quot;if I had a gun now, I would kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
24. Gaobaoling invited me to Jinling restaurant for dinner. She said I could 
bring someone with me. She thought I would bring a male classmate, such as the 
Lu Jun. I brought dongjingping. She ordered three beef burgers, with a layer of 
Pu cake on top and bottom, and a particularly thick ground beef (pressed) in the 
middle. It was very delicious. Then she ordered a fruit platter alone. I ate the 
fruit in the platter in front of her with chopsticks and shared it with her. 
Dong Jingping watched.<br>
<br>
When checking out, the waiter came to her. She took out her wallet and gave it 
to the waiter. The waiter went to the front desk and gave it to her afterwards. 
She put it on her body without looking at it.<br>
<br>
Later, dongjingping told me that she asked dongjingping if she was my 
girlfriend.<br>
<br>
25. Gaobaoling and I went to the second-hand bicycle market to sell her 
bicycles. When we went there, we each rode one and sold one. When we came back, 
we rode one together. At first, I took her. She was tall, big and plump. I 
couldn&#39;t take her. She took me instead. A man whistled to us.<br>
<br>
26. Once I took a bus from Nanjing to Jurong and found Xuqian. She had already 
worked in a shopping mall. I asked her to borrow her bike so that I could ride 
back to my hometown, regardless of her commute.<br>
<br>
27. At the senior high school students&#39; gathering in the winter vacation of 
freshman year, Mr. Fu said to communicate, and Mr. Ji asked me to say, I said to 
march in thought, study novels, and just pass the physical education. They 
laughed. Although it was my birthday, I told my vassals DengLiJun and Xuzhimo 
about it. Liu Hui laughed and asked Zhang Aiqin to leave her address. She 
changed her name to Zhang Qi. Liu Hui said that I had changed. I said that it 
would be good if I changed. Although I prepared a cake for my birthday and 
brought it, I was very scared. After that, they danced and played cards. Hong 
Xin told me to leave. I asked the manager to divide the cake into 16 portions. 
Everyone ate together. They greeted each other one by one, and then joined Hong, 
duxiaoyan, jiangliping and other senior classes. Looking back in bed, I am so 
happy, Xu Qian, so beautiful, so beautiful.<br>
<br>
30. Once, when she was lying on the bed in the foreign students&#39; dormitory of 
carina Fung, I laid my head on her stomach and she said, &quot;don&#39;t be too 
comfortable.&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
31. Because I have a relationship with the second canteen, I often invite 
foreign students to dinner. Once, carina Fei and her colleagues insisted on 
inviting me to dinner on Qingdao Road. They made it an AA system and said I 
would not pay. One night during the parade, they bought soda in the drum tower. 
They also asked for AA. I paid for it alone.<br>
<br>
32. On one trip, I pasted a paper leaflet behind the body of a beautiful 
overseas student. She didn&#39;t blame me. She carried the leaflet on her back and 
continued to swim. The students laughed.<br>
<br>
33. Wendeshu, a senior student of Nanjing foreign university in the same 
village, met him only once in Nanjing University after four years of University. 
It happened that when he was approaching the roadside of my dormitory, he seemed 
to be waiting for me. I told him that he would go to Beijing. Later, I stayed in 
school. My uncle came to see me. He was very angry at me and took me home 
immediately. It turned out that Deshu went back to his hometown and told my 
father that I was going to Beijing. The whole family was worried. Grandma said 
that my father didn&#39;t have the energy to work. Dad said that people were gone. 
What else would he do?<br>
<br>
34. During this period, I went home once. When I returned to school, the 
students said that many people had posted and returned. Carina said to me, will 
you come from F? It was the first time that I heard this noun and didn&#39;t 
understand its meaning.<br>
<br>
35. During this period, I went to the toilet downstairs in Tiananmen Square. It 
was really clean. I had never seen such a clean toilet. The water kept flushing.<br>
<br>
36. Before returning to Nanjing, I walked along Wangfujing Street with Dai 
Weiyang. I was barefoot, carrying cloth shoes and wearing laughter.<br>
<br>
38. Once I was walking on campus with a female international student. I threw a 
piece of waste paper. She wanted me to pick it up anyway.<br>
<br>
39. A female overseas student told me not to call black overseas students black, 
but African.<br>
<br>
40. During the trip, a female overseas student told me that there were many 
rapes in the United States. She said the English word first, but I didn&#39;t 
understand it. She said the English word to another female overseas student, who 
said Chinese rape, and then she said Chinese rape to me.<br>
<br>
41. During the tour, I went to Gulou square with a big butt female international 
student. On her way back to school, she told me that the Chinese touched her 
butt.<br>
<br>
42. Once she asked a female international student to borrow 10 yuan, but she 
refused, saying that she would be uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
43. Later, Mr. Xu said that you can have any thoughts as long as you don&#39;t say 
them. It can be seen that autocracy is poisonous. The reader comments on it.<br>
<br>
44. On the campus road once, I told the teacher that the surplus value was all 
given to the workers, and the capitalists invested and managed it without any 
points. Is it reasonable? The teacher is right, but we can&#39;t exploit too hard.<br>
<br>
45. For some time, I spent all day with female overseas students. My classmate 
(Shan Xiaopeng) called me a national hero. I gave a beautiful overseas student a 
ring. She asked Lu Jun secretly, what do I mean?<br>
<br>
46. Once, when she was watching a movie with an American student, carina 
Ferdinand, at the drum tower dawn cinema, she suddenly burst out laughing, but I 
didn&#39;t think it was funny at all, so she told me that often, when Chinese people 
think it&#39;s funny, foreigners don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny, but when foreigners think 
it&#39;s funny, Chinese people don&#39;t laugh.<br>
<br>
47. Once on the north garden lawn, I asked what homosexuality was all about? 
Carina said, do you know that you have two holes in your body.<br>
<br>
48. As a senior, I helped at gaoniu B stall, a Jianghu friend. This stall is in 
the name of Xu Ming. Gao, Xu Ming, a partner and I. Gao Niu B told his partner 
that Xu Ming didn&#39;t know that we worked for him. Now I wonder if this stall was 
built for me, and if gaoniu B said that they worked for me.<br>
<br>
49. I took jiangxuezhang to the movies. I was penniless, but there were Jianghu 
friends on the street. She and I went to a friend who sold fruit at the back 
door of the school first. We got the movie ticket money and watched six episodes 
of a dream of Red Mansions. I slept while watching. When we returned to school, 
I walked with her. I said that we could ask the students in front for a 
cigarette and smoke when we asked. Just then, a Mazda friend came to take us to 
the drum tower stall. I ate dumplings with her, and then asked Gao Niu B for 
money to pay.<br>
<br>
She said she wanted to stay out of school all night. I didn&#39;t agree and took her 
back to school.<br>
<br>
50. Carina Fei must not study on Friday night, but only entertain. At that time, 
they had a two-day weekend. We don&#39;t have the concept of not studying this 
weekend night.<br>
<br>
51. Once I was walking in the street with someone, a fortune teller shouted to 
me: &quot;Zhu De&#39;s eyebrows&quot;. My eyebrows were very thick, but I didn&#39;t care about 
him and didn&#39;t stop.<br>
<br>
52. During the school transportation, I took a truck with strange students and 
drove out of Tiananmen Square. A classmate read a manuscript, and soon everyone 
found that this was not good, because when a truck drove by, you read a long 
manuscript, and passers-by could not hear anything. The students changed their 
slogan: &quot;Li Peng steps down and the people get up!&quot;<br>
<br>
53. One morning, I got on a milk truck and drove out from the square. There were 
mainly workers on the bus. Some people drank milk. It seemed that I also drank a 
bottle of milk. My foot was pressed by a worker, and I was too shy to say (a 
little afraid to say) until I got off the bus.<br>
<br>
54. In summer, when walking on Nanyuan Road, a girl walked towards each other. 
When I met her, she cried out and I said I was sorry, but neither of us stopped 
and walked away.<br>
<br>
55. I went to Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge with my classmates from other 
schools. Some people were sitting on the bridge, with the Yangtze River at their 
feet. There were also girls. I couldn&#39;t imagine being afraid of heights. When I 
returned to school, a girl leaned on me on the bus. She was very happy, as if 
she were from Anhui University.<br>
<br>
56. After the school sports, when I was selling movie tickets at school, I once 
shouted &quot;Hu Yaobang praised this movie&quot;. Liu Yuan said that he was clever. A 
student condemned me. I said that I remembered Hu Yaobang with it. What did you 
do?<br>
<br>
57. During a parade, I put a red flower in my white sweater chest. The students 
objected and said that I sold tickets. I dare to pick it.<br>
<br>
When I returned to school (east gate) after a parade, I shouted, &quot;Give back my 
girlfriend.&quot; The students laughed.<br>
<br>
58. Swimming in the Nanda swimming pool, when I saw a woman swimming in the 
opposite direction, I went backstroke to meet her so as to hit my head.<br>
<br>
There was a woman who could not swim. I taught her to hold her chin with my 
hands, and I held her chest with my hands. She stopped learning.<br>
<br>
59. In the square, the government built a long row of temporary toilets beside 
the square, which is quite spectacular.<br>

<br>
This morning, my father sent me to Nantah, and my mother and Yicheng sent me to 
Liuqiao station. When I came to Nanjing, my uncle came to pick me up. After 
reporting for duty, I met qinyibin. Tangjinghua, xushuangxi, Hong Weibing and 
fankexia also came to me. I&#39;m so happy. Is this the beginning of the dream, 
mystery and fantasy university?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0909<br>
<br>
Today, I went to the street and felt new and proud when I arrived in the city. I 
walked around at will and felt like I was flying up. I sent a letter to my 
brother, but I couldn&#39;t hide my pride: &quot;today I&#39;m talking to you in Zhenjiang at 
Nantah.&quot;. I bought &quot;out of the window&quot; and &quot;several sunsets&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0910<br>
<br>
At noon, Hua Ping paid a visit to attend the opening ceremony of the center for 
Sino American cultural studies of NTU Hopkins University. I bought a postcard 
and wrote it to my teacher, father and classmates.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I had a &quot;Introduction to Literature&quot; class, which was 
interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0911<br>
<br>
During the physical examination today, I was really afraid that my eyesight 
would go wrong. When I wanted to check it, shixiaoye said to fill it in by 
himself. The speaker was careless and the listener was intentional. I really did 
this, but I was found out. What should I do? Repudiation.<br>
<br>
He submitted the &quot;short frequency and fast&quot; draft of &quot;offering sacrifices to 
ancestors on New Year&#39;s Eve&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, I had to register in the afternoon, but the physical examination 
form was in the doctor&#39;s office. I went to see her and retested her eyesight. I 
failed first, and then I went to find a 750 degree one. It was qualified. But 
she still insisted that the signature was not from a doctor (as it was), but I 
had a big quarrel with her. Finally, I knew that my arm could not bend my thigh 
and gave in.<br>
<br>
After talking with the counselor, he realized that it was serious and wrote a 
review before he passed.<br>
<br>
I registered this afternoon. It was very troublesome. This evening, Jurong 25 
gathered and chatted at Nantah. It was very nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0913<br>
<br>
Today, when the counselors were talking and watching the NTU introduction video, 
I found sunmei and zhengrenxiang sitting together. I had seen it in my student 
ID card. I was wearing a black suit with flowing hair, just to my shoulder. I 
had a delicate nose, a sleepy mouth, a smile, and my eyes were full of dreams. I 
couldn&#39;t help feeling excited. She was escorted to Nanjing University. She once 
participated in Qingdao 82, the listening and writing contest, the learning from 
Lei Feng and other composition awards. Today, she can take her seat according to 
the number. She also paid special attention to her. He was dressed in a shirt 
with yellow bottom and black stripes, and his white trousers were slightly sky 
blue. He was just like sitting there, with the same hair and skin so white, so 
tender and lovely. My heart suddenly fell on her, as well as the youngest member 
of Shandong writers&#39; Association.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0914<br>
<br>
Today I had a rest. I went to Huping&#39;s house, where my uncle worked as a 
carpenter, and talked with him. He will go back to harvest rice tomorrow. It&#39;s 
difficult to take an English test at night! My English.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Today&#39;s school meeting, the opening ceremony.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Another meeting was held and the school continued its opening ceremony.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0917<br>
<br>
Today, the dean&#39;s professional introduction is not very good.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s not very good to watch the movie &quot;male citizen&quot; in the evening.<br>
<br>
Today, when I selected the class committee and announced my name, I was worried. 
No, alas! I don&#39;t know how disappointed I am.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Today&#39;s class begins. Modern Chinese, jiangqinhua, is OK. A Japanese student, 
Yoshimi Mishan, said it was still canyoumei, or Miyuki. She laughed. I met two 
Japanese students, just like us. I had a philosophy class in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
Today&#39;s Mid Autumn Festival, I went to Xuanwu Lake to watch the moon in the 
evening. I didn&#39;t pass by. Two girls, Yan Ling and Su Zhaohui, went with me. 
They bought soda and moon cakes and played for a while. I was very happy. My 
heart was warm and my body was surrounded by friendship.<br>
<br>
Back, I got on the bus at Xuanwu Lake to the drum tower with two girls. When I 
got on the bus, I took a seat for su. She refused, and I refused, so I didn&#39;t 
want to sit. It was time to get off at the first stop. But when I saw Jiming 
temple, I thought I hadn&#39;t arrived. The car was &quot;next stop Jiming Temple&quot;. I 
shouted wrong. They couldn&#39;t help it. I had an idea. I asked the driver to stop. 
The three got off, went back to the drum tower, and then went to Nanjing 
University. On the road, I walked with two girls. I was nervous, happy, 
overwhelmed and subtle. In the evening, Deng Jin and Liu Linlan came to see Chen 
Jintao. They made an appointment with a female foreign language student of grade 
85. They said that they were already members of Xuetong news agency because of 
their short frequency and fast manuscripts. Ha!<br>

On the introduction to linguistics, wangxijie, OK. Writing, wangjizhi. After 
school, I met zhengrenxiang and said that it was Liu Hui who said hello to me. 
She said this sentence three times before I understood it and talked with her 
for a long time. Hometown people, kiss or not. She said that I learned from 
yunyun, a reporter of the news agency. She didn&#39;t contribute. She wanted to wait 
and say more. It seemed that she was a little regretful. Daiweiyang said that I 
learned from the News Agency reporter, and jiangsuping spoke again. Only then 
did he know that the school had issued a notice. After reading it in the 
evening, he was really learning from the News Agency reporter. He was very 
happy. Fortunately, it was great. He didn&#39;t worry about the class Committee, and 
he was full of the spirit of doing a good job.<br>
<br>
I have written to Liuhui, Xuqian, wangbeiyu, etc. so far, I have written 14 
letters. Only then did I receive a letter from my father brought by my uncle at 
noon. My grandmother sent me a box of moon cakes. Thinking about them, I know 
what to do.<br>
<br>
There are so many new students&#39; letters, one by one. Before, I only had five 
letters, but now there are 14. It&#39;s incredible. I&#39;m eager to receive letters, 
which is a satisfaction I&#39;ve never had.<br>
<br>
Sitting behind Sun Mei in the morning class, I was very satisfied.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Today, I had no classes. I walked around the street all day. I went to the drum 
tower early and bought some things. In the afternoon, I went to Xinjiekou to buy 
books and clothes for my brother, but I didn&#39;t buy any.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to the Xuetong news agency to hold a meeting. I had to 
contribute and earn points. I was promoted to official reporter yunyun. Every 
Friday, I was on duty and compiled blackboard newspapers. See sunmei again. She 
goes to the student union. I suddenly had the desire to write everything out, 
and the creative cells filled my body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0921<br>
<br>
In the morning, xuhaiying (Nanjing College of traditional Chinese Medicine) 
visited Nanjing Normal University and met Hua Ping.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I did my homework and read the blackboard newspaper &quot;college 
students&quot; and &quot;Nanjing University Youth&quot;. It really suits my taste, especially 
the article &quot;falling in love&quot;. I really have the desire to create.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I wrote three more letters, seventeen of which were fun.<br>
<br>
After receiving Guan Hong&#39;s letter, I talked about the popularity of love in the 
class. Girls have a history of love. I think I have the responsibility to write 
about things at this age. Before writing, he thought that he was worshipped for 
his name and made money for his contributions.<br>
<br>
Now I feel that I should help others, help myself, help others, treat life 
correctly, vent, seek resonance and comfort myself. Is this the correct creative 
concept?<br>
<br>
In the evening, I found out the books I had brought with me and the past 
articles, determined to do a big job, and wrote all the University diaries, but 
I hope that similar events will occur less in the future, and I will write them 
the next day.<br>
<br>

In the morning, I went to &quot;Introduction to Linguistics&quot; to find the rose. I 
didn&#39;t find it for a long time. I saw one by one with a flowing thread. I just 
wore a green tight jacket. I guess it was her first, and then I couldn&#39;t find 
it. Look carefully. Who is she? After a good look, my heart wandered.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I wrote &quot;dormitory for male college students&quot; and contributed.<br>
<br>
In the evening class, I sat in front of the two girls and looked for roses. My 
face became more vivid. Suddenly I heard two words &quot;classmate&quot; and &quot;classmate&quot;, 
which came from behind. It was a woman&#39;s call. When I turned around, the man 
with glasses looked at me, and I turned around. She borrowed my textbook from 
me. I was flattered and gave it to her without thinking. They both said &quot;thank 
you&quot; and I said &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;, Later, the teacher asked: has the Japanese 
student come? I see that the girl raised her hand. I&#39;m so happy. I really feel 
that the Japanese girl is very beautiful.<br>
<br>
After class, I looked back. The girl understood, gave me the book and said 
thanks. Then I was smart, gave them the book and said, &quot;you don&#39;t have any 
books. I&#39;ll give them to you.&quot; The Japanese girl said, &quot;I have. Here you are, 
teacher. Thank you.&quot; How sweet!<br>
<br>
Wang Yingguo gave a very good lecture on &quot;reading works&quot;, especially his 
admiration for Lu Xun and Bajin, which was deeply in my mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0923<br>
<br>
In the morning, I borrowed the second handshake.<br>
<br>
In the morning, I had a physical education class (theory class) and became 
interested in the ball, single bars and parallel bars. I will practice later.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went shopping with Dai Weiyang to buy books for my brother. 
As a result, I went to the &quot;Xinhua Bookstore&quot; for a long time, but I didn&#39;t buy 
any. I bought a suit jacket (34.5 yuan) at the people&#39;s shopping mall. It&#39;s 
brown. It&#39;s very good<br>

I put in a draft of &quot;short frequency fast&quot; and published it. I&#39;m happy! The 
evening party (class), the festival is OK, but I have nothing, so is the rose. 
Chengtonghua asked me if I was from Fujian. I said Jianfu. Dengjinjiang 
sentence.<br>
<br>
Come back in the evening and have a chat with zhengrenxiang.<br>
<br>
A gift, a Book (from xuqun) and a postcard. Bad luck.<br>
<br>
I played on the single parallel bars in the evening, but my jeans were 
scattered.<br>
<br>
In the evening, there was a lot of talk about young men and women. They all 
seemed to have something, but I had nothing. What a pity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0925<br>
<br>
I sat in a row with rose in class. She always wrote about creation. I was moved 
by it. I also wrote farewell to my hometown and devoted myself to &quot;college 
students&quot;. I lined up white paper to draw her photos and put my student ID card 
on it. It was very nice.<br>
<br>
I am so moved to receive Wang Beiyu&#39;s letter. A friend!<br>
<br>
I have written 19 letters (plus seven postcards), received 6, and read the 
letters from my classmates (one dormitory). I really envy Dai Weiyang. People 
love him, but I have nothing? Rose!<br>
<br>
In the evening, he attended the orientation party in the name of Xuetong News 
Agency reporter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0926<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, there were three classes of &quot;writing&quot;. Leaning on rose, there 
were two classes that looked at her. She received the book &quot;juvenile literature 
and art&quot;. I?<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to learn from the news agency to compile &quot;short frequency 
and fast&quot;, and I also wrote the bullshit words on it. Later, I observed more and 
decided to interview.<br>

<br>
In the evening, I attended the Chinese Department&#39;s orientation party and 
watched the movie &quot;the death line of the glacier&quot;. I just sat in front of the 
rose. I was in an unknown mood, happy, proud, restrained, but afraid and uneasy. 
Previously, I was too restrained, I was too big to breathe. I sat upright and 
crooked. Later, I watched the program, which was more natural. Guitar, dancing, 
drama, and taking photos in the dormitory at night have been playing for a long 
time. I sigh that life is like a dream.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0928<br>
<br>
In the morning, when he was woken up, it was said that chengtonghua fell from 
the upper bunk and was sent to the hospital. He could not help thinking about 
it, and his feelings were pricked.<br>
<br>
After watching Bajin&#39;s autumn, I screamed absolutely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0929<br>
<br>
At noon, I took my glasses and bought a pair of trousers. Now I have a set of 47 
yuan. I took ID photos in the morning.<br>
<br>
At noon, I put on my suit. It was very good. I went to find Tan Derong, 
zhengrenxiang and Zhuning, sun Guang and Hisense. I didn&#39;t find it at first, and 
then I found it in the evening. After talking for a while, I really didn&#39;t want 
to go. Dengjin and rose were also in Yuner. Later, I had no choice but to go. In 
the evening, I had a reading class. It&#39;s really good to talk about my heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the afternoon, I went to Xuanwu Lake with Shi Xiaoye. I wore a suit and 
bought a tie. He said I was foreign and funny. I went in and saw many people 
rowing, but the wind was strong and there were few people. I had never rowed, so 
I insisted on not rowing. I went to the zoo and saw something I had never seen 
in my life. Panda, red panda (yellow all over), wolf, Pang, tiger, leopard, 
lion, Shin deer, horse, camel, hippo, peacock, many unknown birds, there was an 
acacia bird. I remember very well, and then he left. I watched it alone and 
walked around. I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t watch one of them. I watched it twoorthree 
times. The big black bear and the monkeys were very interesting.<br>
<br>
Later, I saw that many young people were right. I felt very sad. I really wanted 
to be a lovely person, a middle school girl. No matter how beautiful she was, 
how nice it would be to spend annoying time with me. Later, I saw a man who was 
proud of himself. He was with me. I was really disappointed.<br>
<br>
Watching night market movies at night, from 11:00 to 5:00 tomorrow morning,

young men catching bandits&quot; and &quot;divine whip&quot;, I really wanted to sleep. I also 
slept for a few seconds, but the effect was too bad. I still saw the beautiful 
girls behind me, but I was in charge. I felt happy for a while. Alas.<br>

I came back from the cinema at 5 a.m., bought four fried dough sticks on the 
street and ate them indiscriminately. I went back to the dormitory and fell 
asleep. It was already 11:30 when I woke up. After lunch, I felt disappointed 
and didn&#39;t want to go out. In the afternoon, I slept until more than 6:00. I got 
up. It was dark. I went out to eat two bowls of bread and butter. I don&#39;t know 
what to do. I went to the dormitory and went to sleep. These days, sadness has 
attacked my heart from time to time. My feelings are too fragile. In a word, 
&quot;where is my lovely she?&quot; how I yearn for that love. I have never been so 
hungry, I&#39;m going crazy. I&#39;m not interested in doing anything. What should I do? 
Tell me. Alas.<br>

Today&#39;s day has passed in vain.<br>
<br>
In the morning, I wrote three letters to my family, saying that I should study 
hard. To wangbeiyu and Guan Hong, we can talk about our loneliness and seek 
comfort because we are longing for the love of the opposite sex.<br>

Today, I issued a press card, saying that I had to pay 50 cents.<br>
<br>
Lingshi collided with zhengrenxiang. She wanted to find qinyibin. When she found 
him, she said something. I took an excuse to slip away. I went to publish a 
short frequency express. When I went to the dormitory, I talked with Zheng. It 
was funny that Chen Jintao left alone.<br>

I can&#39;t cope with English Intensive Reading in the morning.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the library and was rushed back because of the visit 
of prime minister Peterson of Ontario, Canada.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched movies, concerts, and then the Asian Games.<br>
<br>
The men&#39;s volleyball team won 3:1 against South Korea.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m glad, but the gold medals are China 92, South Korea 92 and Japan 93.<br>

In the afternoon, de Rong and Hua Ping went to zhengrenxiang&#39;s dormitory and 
asked her to go to the Imperial Mausoleum (Nanjing Teachers&#39; College). Deng Jin 
was drunk with peony smoke. After seeing her registration, her mother was 
gebaozhu. She had the same surname as me. She felt very kind. She couldn&#39;t help 
paying attention. 550 points, this boy.<br>
<br>
Take the bus to Zhongshan Bridge, walk in Baoshan Street for a long time, and 
then get to Nantong road to Nanjing Normal College. But Wang Ling played 
football and went home disappointed.<br>
<br>
It rained heavily when I came back. I took shelter from the rain in a snack bar 
and ate mixed meat and oil.<br>
<br>
After returning, I received a letter from Zhao Tingxi, saying that g was not 
worth love. Liu Hui had prince charming. Xu Qian had been there for three or 
four years. Wang Xiaoping was shot by qinyimin, qinyibin&#39;s brother. However, 
Konghui said that she should write a letter to Yun. She felt a little ashamed. 
Ah, I really don&#39;t know what to say.<br>
<br>
Today, the Chinese team won 2 medals in the Asian Games, a total of 94, firmly 
winning the first place.<br>

In the afternoon, I received three letters. Guan Hong, Daosheng and wangbeiyu 
were very happy. Unexpectedly, I sent a letter to Guan Hong. She wrote to me at 
this time. Her letter was as dull and sad as I mentioned in my letter, because 
her good friend fulili betrayed her, saying that it was the greatest pain in her 
life, and she could not see friendship. She hated Fu, hated people who made her 
sympathize with pity but didn&#39;t know and know. She loved the imperial mausoleum, 
but now she doesn&#39;t love anyone. She admires me yun&#39;er. I&#39;m looking forward to 
hearing from you, my God! It&#39;s a joke. When I was lonely, when I talked to her 
and asked for help, she was saying the same sadness to me.<br>
<br>
I suddenly felt an unknown taste in my heart, sour and drunk. Alas, how can I 
say? She is always my first and only girl friend, Guan Hong, Guan Hong. 
Daosheng&#39;s letter really moved me. My old classmate&#39;s warm words also brought me 
the news of Er Qiao. I sent a letter to my two good friends, Daosheng and ER 
Qiao.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the children&#39;s theater to watch the play ninety-nine 
and a half. When I saw sunmei and zhaoqingping laughing at each other, I sat 
with several male classmates. I felt a bad feeling in my heart. Deng Jin sat in 
row 27 and I sat in row 29. She and zhengrenxiang came over and nodded and 
laughed with me. I was so moved that I nodded. She asked me, &quot;who else is in the 
twenty seventh row?&quot; I said no cloud, sincere fear, kiss you.<br>
<br>
Coming and going with Dai Weiyang, they marched suddenly. It was very 
interesting to pretend to be a couple. It was really that day.<br>
<br>
I remember the first time we met, Deng said, &quot;did you write short frequency fast 
in the summer vacation?&quot; I said yes. &quot;Someone wants you to go to the small 
pavilion in front of the eight House&quot;, yun&#39;er, remembering that, i. Dengjin, 
Dengjin!<br>

Because Xu Shuangxi borrowed the earphone last night, he borrowed it from 
qinyibin this morning. He was very enthusiastic. In the morning, I saw that rose 
was wearing a sportswear. Somehow, I had a different feeling in my heart. In the 
past, I loved her and wanted to treat her shortcomings as advantages. Today, I 
want to change my advantages into disadvantages, but I can&#39;t.<br>
<br>
In physical education, I decided to take volleyball as an elective course, and 
Tan Derong was the same. When tangjinghua came to school, he told hujunning that 
he had lost more than 30 yuan. Alas.<br>
<br>
At noon, Qin Yibin was invited to play go with jiangsuping. Later, Qin won.<br>
<br>
I received a letter from Xu Qian. Although I was moved, she had no intention to 
give it to me. I&#39;m sorry that there was no photo. I am so poor.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I still enjoyed reading my works. I talked about the madman&#39;s 
diary and became more and more convinced of Lu Xun. I got to know a young 
teacher of Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University (surnamed Zhang) during recess to study and 
leave addresses for each other. He is 12-126.<br>
<br>

In today&#39;s &quot;Introduction to Literature&quot; class, Hu Youqing quoted Freud&#39;s point 
of view and divided human nature into three aspects: Freud, ego and super ego. 
Ed comes down to sexuality, an uncontrollable instinct. The ego is the objective 
control, and the superego is the conscience control cloud. Literary and artistic 
works are the artistic cloud expressed by writers who process people&#39;s 
imaginative dreams. Although it is partial, it is very appropriate.<br>
<br>
At noon, rose and Du Jing were talking to zhaoqingping on the porch. I was very 
unfair. Alas, pity me for my tenderness and one-sided love. Can&#39;t you really get 
it?<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I watched a dream of Red Mansions and liked it more and more. 
Do I want to be Jia Baoyu? &quot;Women are made of water and men are made of mud&quot;, 
women cloud, rose.<br>
<br>

I also saw a dream of Red Mansions, Jia Baoyu.<br>
<br>
In the three &quot;philosophy&quot; classes in the afternoon, rose was sitting in front of 
me, and my soul was flying! Looking at her and a dream of Red Mansions, as soon 
as she looked up, her waterfall of silver hair was on my desk. I pushed the book 
in front of her, and her hair was on my book again. When the wind blew, another 
page of the book caught her hair, and I felt proud, just like I had her heart.<br>
<br>
When she turned her head, her face was white and tender, with charming luster. 
That was the face made of water. It was revealed and made me intoxicated. I also 
found that her teeth were black, but I felt that her black teeth were very 
beautiful. That figure and posture are really soft and handsome. Rose, rose, I 
love you!<br>
<br>
I had an idea. I pulled out my hair and put it in the pen holder. Then I touched 
her dense hair. It was so fascinating, as if I had kissed her.<br>
<br>
I received a letter from Li Erqiao today. He was very happy that he hadn&#39;t 
received my letter yet. Looking at it, I was about to cry. He said it very sad, 
because he only passed the Danyang normal school. He thought of death and asked 
the fortune teller yun&#39;er. Friend, my friend, you, you, what can I do for you? 
He asked me to go to Zhenjiang to play. It happened that hongjiwu wanted to go 
to my brother&#39;s place, so he wanted to ask him to go. He must go!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
I&#39;m glad to see Erqiao and others in Zhenjiang. His name was hongjiwu at noon. 
He said he would go later. Sun Yong was called, and he readily responded.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, &quot;writing&quot; class, composition lectures.<br>
<br>
To be true, I read jiangsuping&#39;s letter to her dead grandmother. It&#39;s very good. 
After reading a little more, I felt inferior. Another cloud wrote 16 letters to 
my lover, and then sent them to me. One of the seven 95 points said that I was a 
&quot;landscape artist&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the evening, my uncle came to me for ten yuan. He came back from Wuhan and 
will go home tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I saw the film Nie Er.<br>

In the morning, I received Guan Hong&#39;s letter. I was very proud and 
disappointed.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to Zhenjiang with sunyong and took a bus to the central gate bus 
station. There were no tickets left. I went to the railway station and bought a 
14:21 express. When we were walking around the station, we might as well be 
caught by a fat woman who said that we would be fined. I couldn&#39;t figure it out. 
I asked her why, but she didn&#39;t say it clearly. I was afraid of making trouble. 
I gave her ten yuan. I thought she couldn&#39;t find it. She took it and really sent 
a stack of money, all of which were 20 cents, 10 cents and 50 cents, mostly 
fines. We thought we had gone the wrong way and should not go this way, yun&#39;er. 
I dare not go after the trouble. Later, I learned that she thought I was 
spitting. It was really useless.<br>
<br>
It was fun to take the train for the first time.<br>
<br>
When I got off the Zhenjiang station, I looked for the picture, saw the bus 
station and teachers&#39; College, so I waited for the bus, took bus No. 11 to the 
bus station, got off and walked east for a long time, thinking of the College of 
education. After walking for a long time, I looked up and met a man like 
liyouwen. Shouting loudly, I found fengqingrong and cuihui in front of me. I 
really met my old friend in a foreign land. Very excited. It&#39;s a coincidence 
that Li Erqiao is here and Yun Shijun is coming. When I arrived at fengqingrong 
of the teachers&#39; College, I ate melon seeds and decided to go to wangbeiyu. When 
he came out, he saw a man like Er Qiao. He greeted him happily, shook hands with 
him, and felt a little sad. He went to wangbeiyu&#39;s place. He didn&#39;t expect me to 
come. Zhoudaobao and lijinlin were also there. Everyone was very excited. Hua 
Ting dared to come, so he went to dinner.<br>
<br>
Many people eat together. It&#39;s really interesting to have dinner for the first 
time.<br>
<br>
After eating on the playground, I saw hexianmei and a hairdresser and said 
hello. It turned out that it was biyunqing. I didn&#39;t think it was a gimmick. He 
went to call her again. After stopping the call, Taoist returned from his 
inspection of Jinshan. He was very happy to meet her.<br>
<br>
After a while, before the girls arrived, we went to the street for a stroll, 
smoked cigarettes and had fun. Go to Wang Beiyu of the teachers&#39; college to play 
cards and listen to the songs. After a while, jiangliping and Xie Daodi come. 
The latter is not recognized. Jiang said I despise it, but I said it has changed 
a lot. After a while, hexianmei and some women came to play. They didn&#39;t know 
each other, but they were beautiful.<br>
<br>
He talked to me and I asked her to Nanjing on the 25th. In the evening, Hong Xin 
and someone asked me to go to the canteen. I hardly paid any attention to her. 
He must have gone later, so he went. When he saw someone calling me, he was 
afraid of not knowing me. He called again. It was hongjiwu, so he asked him 
where he came from. He said that after watching the night market movie, he came 
to Zhenjiang by train and wanted to taste the taste of long-distance travel. 
When he arrived in Shanghai, he was fined, spent more than ten yuan, and ran 
back to Zhenjiang by the original ticket. He said he would go to see my brother 
in the evening. They got up and down with wangbeiyu. They were very excited and 
talked a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I got up this morning, had dinner, and made an appointment with some girls to go 
out to play. Hong Jiwu said he couldn&#39;t find my brother, so he continued to go 
today.<br>
<br>
After a while, Hong Xin came. She wanted to talk to me first, but she was 
afraid. Hexianmei was angry with her. She came. When Li Erqiao told me, I 
shouted, &quot;Hong Xin&quot;. I was very sorry. She said she couldn&#39;t recognize me. I 
also said that she was much more beautiful than before.<br>
<br>
After talking for a while, everyone went out. Hua Ting dares to borrow a camera. 
I took a bus to Jiaoshan park first. It was crowded to death. When we took a 
boat to Jiaoshan in the middle of the river, we had another feast for our eyes. 
We saw stone tablets everywhere, and the posthumous writings of celebrities such 
as Luyou, Sudongpo, zhengbanqiao, Xin Qiji, and Qianlong opened our eyes. There 
are many couplets and verses. After reading them, I couldn&#39;t bear to leave. 
Climb the mountain and climb up to Sanzhao cave. Emperor Xian of the Han Dynasty 
sent Jiao gong out of the mountain. Banqiao bookstore, I took a picture at the 
river sucking building on the top of Jiaoshan mountain.<br>
<br>
I went down the mountain to the ancient fort and visited the tombstone for a 
good meeting. Then we went to Dinghui temple and Mahavira hall, saw eight great 
steel, Buddha, goddess of mercy and so on, shouted &quot;absolutely&quot; and bought a 
souvenir -- goddess of mercy. Jiaoshan Giant Buddha is very kind. When he got to 
Wendu Pavilion, he took a boat back.<br>
<br>
I went to the teachers&#39; College for lunch, ate at hexianmei, and ate with the 
girls the rice bowl that the girls had eaten for a long time. It was fun.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to the Institute of education for a meeting. Later, the second 
Qiao left. I repeatedly asked him to go to Nanjing on the 25th. Then I went to 
luozhihua&#39;s office, the police school, and to Jinshan, the symbol of Zhenjiang.<br>
<br>
Go to Jiangtian temple first, and then go to Chaoyang cave, Bailong cave and 
Tathagata cave. Later, I went to the cishou pagoda and took color photos. 
Climbing the seven storey roof, you can have a panoramic view of the whole 
Zhenjiang river. The boundary is wide and far. All the mountains and rivers are 
in front of you. It&#39;s fun to go down to drill the eight trigrams array and run 
around without coming out. After grasping the characteristic of keeping to the 
right, he came out. It&#39;s interesting.<br>
<br>
After dinner at the teachers&#39; College, I said goodbye one by one. When I went to 
Jiangsu Institute of technology, I found Zhuyun and had a talk. I had to wait 
for the train to go to the railway station. First, I went to the east gate. 
Wangbeiyu and zhoudaobao got off and went back to the teachers&#39; college. Sunyong 
and I continued to wait for the train. It was so busy that we looked a little 
pitiful and cold.<br>
<br>
After that, I took the bus to the railway station, bought a 11:30 p.m. ticket, 
bought apples and oranges, and took the bus to school. Lin yueen opened the door 
and went to sleep.<br>
<br>
In Nanjing, I used to think that high school was like a dream. When I met my old 
classmates in Zhenjiang, I felt that life at Nanjing University was like a 
dream. When I arrived at Nanjing University, I felt friendly. But in Zhenjiang, 
it was like a dream. Everything in the past was a dream, but now it is the most 
realistic. I don&#39;t know anything about it in the future, and I can have fun.<br>

Received xuqunxin.<br>
<br>
I slept for a long time at noon, bought a pair of sports pants on the street and 
watched the human body exhibition. For the first time, although it was a dead 
man with pictures, I saw a woman&#39;s so-called genitals, but they were dead, 
shrunk, thin and full of wrinkles. The vagina was cloudy. At that time, it 
seemed academic. There were a lot of people watching, and it was a bit serious. 
So how did I feel? In fact, it was also very ugly, which reduced my worship of 
women.<br>
<br>
But at night, when I want to come, I am still very excited. It is a woman. The 
world made of water is my breathing air and blood of life.<br>
<br>
Reading the works, talking about the true story of Ah Q and Lu Xun. It&#39;s really 
great.<br>

In the morning, I played volleyball in PE class, which was very good. I regret 
why I didn&#39;t learn something in the past.<br>
<br>
I sent a letter to Guan Hong. It was the first time I had so many pieces of 
paper.<br>
<br>
In the evening class, zhengrenxiang called me and asked me about her trip to 
Zhenjiang. I told her that the teachers&#39; college said she was in vain. I didn&#39;t 
lie for her. Tan Derong told me that they went skating (Saturday) and that there 
was a fellow townsman in Jiangxi who knew it was Dengjin. Sure enough, 
zhengrenxiang took Dengjin&#39;s hand and showed it to me. There was a small piece 
of skin blackened. Dengjin laughed it off.<br>
<br>
After a good look at Rose and a study, it was really beautiful. There were 
absolutely no moves. Laugh frequently, shut up and laugh. They were moving, just 
like a pool of clean water.<br>

In the evening, I went to the reading room (newspaper) with Dai Weiyang, and 
little star was there. After reading a lot of publications, such as getting 
water from a fish, I had been to high school before, so I was vague and aloof. 
When I went there, I swore to come every day. I hated the short time, annoyed 
the administrator, and then I was afraid to go. I feel the same today. I swear I 
will go often to enrich myself.<br>
<br>
After self-study next night, I went to the dormitory and thought of single and 
double shots. I will also exercise every day in the future. College life should 
be good to learn exercise, do not waste time in tasteless fantasy.<br>

After the first audio-visual class (English) in the morning, I didn&#39;t understand 
much. When I saw that the next history department had the same class, I inserted 
it again. It was much better. After that, I played the video again. In the 
future, I will learn English well. It&#39;s worth it if I do it twice.<br>
<br>
I went to Qixia mountain (the whole class) tomorrow and bought English American 
bread (8.50 Jiao) in the evening.<br>

<br>
Take a bus to Qixia mountain in the morning.<br>
<br>
Get on the NANDA bus, go to the drum tower, go to the east of Beijing East Road 
and drive to the suburbs. The bus stops at the roadside to see the stone 
carvings of the Southern Dynasty. Mr. Wang Jizhi takes us and gives us a tour 
guide to a stone carvings like lions, which is said to be the so-called Exorcism 
in front of the tomb of Xiao Yandi between the beams of the Southern Dynasty. 
There is also a god column (a stone column made by God), which is beautifully 
carved, with a covered lotus cover and a dew plate. There are stone hoops on the 
oval of the column body. People are not like people and have no head. Square 
plaque, Hou, Xiao Jing. There is also a stele, Beibei stele, the nine sons of 
the dragon. Emperor Gaozong wrote an imperial tablet.<br>
<br>
Later, I drove to Qixia mountain, also known as &quot;the most beautiful mountain in 
Jinling&quot;, which is covered with red maples in late autumn. Qixia ancient temple 
is one of the &quot;four jungles&quot; in China. Thousand Buddha rock, relic tower. 
Calligraphy of &quot;Qixia&quot;, the imperial monument of Emperor Gaozong of Tang 
Dynasty. It was first built in the Southern Qi Dynasty. Ming monk Shao (No. 
Qixia) lived in seclusion and donated his house to build a temple. Congshan, 
Hushan, Fengxiang mountain, Longshan, Banyue Lake (Fanggong Lake).<br>
<br>
It was my first time to climb a mountain like this. I was a little afraid, but 
also a little adventurous and excited. I climbed it. Walking through the 
withered leaves and smelling the fragrance of flowers, I took two photos on the 
way. One was taken by a Japanese female student for the three of us, and the 
other was taken with a Japanese female student kumei.<br>
<br>
After climbing the main peak Fengxiang peak, the vast Yangtze River looks like a 
white belt. The mountains are small at a glance, and the horizon is really open. 
The mountain wind is very dangerous. I ate bread on the top of the mountain. In 
the afternoon, I went to Linggu Temple, the best jungle in the world in the Ming 
Dynasty, with red walls and green tiles. In 1929, I commemorated the victory of 
the northern expedition, wuliangdian, and the memorial of revolutionary martyrs. 
Three unique steles, written by libaiwen, written by yanzhenqing, painted by 
wudaozi.<br>
<br>
I went to the Xiaoling Mausoleum of the Ming Dynasty and saw the statue of Zhu 
Yuanzhang.<br>
<br>
In the evening, &quot;Introduction to Literature&quot;, old students talk about 
experience. I decided to listen carefully in class and not read novels.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I saw the film &quot;missing middle school girl&quot;, which was not very 
good. It&#39;s a shame to think of me. I&#39;m so big that I have nothing to do.<br>

Today, Qi Zhengping didn&#39;t come to the intensive English reading class. I was 
very happy. She was ill and didn&#39;t attend two classes. She deceived herself and 
others in English.<br>
<br>
Watching the &quot;Freshmen&#39;s concert&quot; in the evening, singing and dancing, is not 
good. The later Chinese drama is not good either. Rose and Xu Qiang dance, 
although beautiful, but I am so angry, so angry, how can I hate.<br>
<br>
It costs 30 yuan to write to my family. I also wrote to Hua tinggan and Wang 
Feng.<br>

In the morning, I went to Yuhuatai, bought a bowl of Yuhua stone, and helped Xu 
Shuangxi find his brother&#39;s box in Chenguang machinery factory. Today, I also 
went to the ancient castle of Zhonghua Gate, which is so majestic, great, high 
and wide, with Qianjin gate, three urn cities, four arches and 27 Tibetan 
soldier caves.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I received Guan Hong&#39;s letter so frequently. I also blamed my 
late reply and said sad words. Could it be that we are both in the same boat. 
Whether she loves me or not, but I won&#39;t love her. She is not beautiful. She has 
been in love. I am. My first love must be dedicated to Nantah sweetheart. But I 
immediately sent her a love letter, calling her a girl. I wrote it that night 
under the candlelight of jiangsuping. I couldn&#39;t sleep at night. My destination.<br>

Today, I received 50 yuan and 40 Jin food stamps from my father. I am very 
grateful. I will study hard, really.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the street to buy a sweatshirt (10.34 yuan) and 
strolled around the street. In the evening, I was still happy to listen to the 
&quot;work reading&quot; class. Lu Xun&#39;s research made me more aware of Lu Xun&#39;s greatness 
and his national character. Rose sat in front of me, and I suddenly felt that 
she was very beautiful. I grabbed the edge of the table with my hand, and she 
leaned against her back and looked up. Her hair, the soft yarn, the cloud like 
fog like softness, the dream like softness, brushed in my hands and stirred 
waves in my heart. It was very comfortable. After so many times, she was 
extremely satisfied, beauty, super beauty, beauty snake. Just her hair leaned 
down, and one of my hair was pulled out and wiped her cloud like fog like hair, 
It&#39;s just that her hair rests on my hand. I&#39;m so comfortable and satisfied. In 
the future, the beauty&#39;s first love will be in the future.<br>

Physical education, volleyball quality and exercise feel good. Why didn&#39;t you 
exercise in the past? I think today is not yesterday. In the future, you should 
exercise well and play more volleyball.<br>
<br>
At noon, Tan Derong went to find luoshouxi (Nanjing Institute of Finance and 
trade), ran for a long time, took the No. 13 bus, ran for a long time, came to a 
dead end -- the end of the fence, and ran back. Because Tan Derong had classes 
in the afternoon, he went back half the way. I ran for a long time and found 
him. He came out with me again, called Huaping, and was not there. He strolled 
around Nanjing Normal University, went to Nanjing Normal University, talked 
about a conversation, and went to find zhengrenxiang. Wang Wenhui was not there, 
and I was not there, The words were a little impolite. He asked me where to go. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; he shook his head. He hated my appearance. How could I offend 
you. Later, I couldn&#39;t wait. I told wangsuxia to ask her to come to my place 
after zhengrenxiang came back. She gladly agreed. Later, she found sunyong with 
luoshouxi and met zhengrenxiang. I went to my dormitory to talk back. Tan Derong 
also came. Later, I took luoshouxi to dinner. After dinner, I went to the Derong 
place to talk about Zhenjiang classmate No. 25 and the place to play with them.<br>
<br>
In the evening, luoshouxi was sent to play in the teaching area. After he got on 
the bus, he came back with sunyong. In the dormitory, everyone had a happy talk. 
Everyone had their own troubles. I have two: 1. I am inferior in some aspects, 
such as singing, photography and tape recorder. 2. I have never had contact with 
female classmates. This is an inferiority complex. He said that people in a 
dormitory, that is, a country and a home, should talk about everything and treat 
each other sincerely.<br>
<br>
I received an interview notice and went to 3--210 (luweijun) to interview the 
chess and Card Association&#39;s plans for this semester. This is my first 
interview.<br>

It&#39;s very cold today. I&#39;m wearing sweaters and sweaters. 12-18 degrees, 
temperature.<br>
<br>
I wrote a letter to my brother at noon. After receiving a letter from Hu Cheng, 
he said that I can get along with others with my advantages. The teacher dotes 
on me, the students envy me, and women favor cloud. It really hurts me, but why 
do I feel so inferior? The past should not have happened, but we should be glad 
that it has passed. My past, all really past, no matter how lovely.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to find Hua Ping and told him that on the 25th, Zhenjiang had 
come to Nanjing for military training.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, Dai Weiyang and I took a bath and shower. It was really 
comfortable.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to interview luweijun (president of the chess and Card 
Association). He was hospitalized with hepatitis, so I had to go to Xuetong News 
Agency for instructions. Yelongfu said to go to 5--604 to find tangweibing. 
Alas, tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Shixiaoye bought a VCR and stereo. It sounds really good.<br>

<br>

<br>
At noon, I went to find tangweibing and climbed up to the 6th floor. When he was 
not there, he did not know where he was. His words were very unfriendly. He was 
so angry that he climbed down again and went back to the dormitory. Check the 
photo with your ID card. It&#39;s really ugly. It&#39;s too thin. Alas!<br>
<br>
At noon and in the evening, I finished my composition &quot;autumn tour of Qixia 
mountain&quot;. After dinner, I went to find tangweibing. He was on the sixth floor 
and was not there. So I had to leave a note and go tomorrow at 12 noon.<br>
<br>
I received a letter from my little brother Yiwen. It was unexpected. I was very 
happy and wrote back to him immediately.<br>
<br>
Tonight, everyone let off steam again, singing their songs loudly, which led 
them to go upstairs and stop. Linyueen said I was &quot;willful&quot;. Is that right?<br>
<br>

At 12 noon, I interviewed tangweibing, President of the chess and card 
association. This was my first interview. I came back to write a manuscript.<br>
<br>
In the evening, Wang Ling came to have a talk. In the evening, zhengrenxiang 
came to play cards and played red 5 fast cards. As a result, I lost and scored 
250 points first.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the &quot;short frequency and fast&quot;, and my interview was 
immediately adopted. The team leader was zhaobing. She was very lively. In the 
evening, Zeng Jianqiang said that we should communicate. I think I should do 
this. First, I should work as a School News Agency reporter. Today, a classmate 
fell to death in the physics building. I immediately felt that the changes in 
life were unpredictable.<br>
<br>
Are the classmates (Zhenjiang) and Li Erqiao coming tomorrow?<br>
<br>

The teacher asked two Japanese students to introduce the cultural differences 
between China and Japan. Nakamura Yuri said, &quot;the Japanese don&#39;t like domestic 
films either. Japanese literature and politics are separated.&quot; Asakawa explained 
that China eats together and Japan eats separately through the length of 
chopsticks, saying that China is equal.<br>
<br>
English intensive reading, no preview, I don&#39;t know, later?<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, luoshouxi came to the station to meet Zhenjiang with him. He 
went to the station at 1:30 and came back at 3:30. He stood at the station for 
more than an hour, but he didn&#39;t come because of the rain. But we had a hard 
time standing. When we saw the bus at 2:20, there was no bus. It was only 5:53, 
so we went back.<br>
<br>
I didn&#39;t go to the meeting. When I came back, my classmates said that they had 
filled in the form and wrote the application. I was in a hurry to find 
shixiaoye. He took me to Hua 1 by bike. I went to Liu Yuan, left half an hour 
ago, went to the Department office, left half an hour ago, and went to the 
dormitory to find him. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t blame me and registered me without 
saying a word. I was very happy and grateful to shixiaoye. He always accompanied 
me and took me by bike. I applied for 300 yuan.<br>
<br>
I was so glad to receive Wang Feng&#39;s letter at noon. He said that it was enough 
to have me as a confidant.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched the video &quot;the true story of Ah Q&quot;, but I didn&#39;t see 
it well. It seems that the words and sentences in Lu Xun&#39;s book are deep, and I 
can&#39;t tell the truth unless I study them carefully.<br>
<br>
From now on, I will start a new life. I will study hard and live four 
down-to-earth lives. I can&#39;t waste a moment. No longer worry about little 
things, put aside everything, think about everything, for everything, get 
everything.<br>

It&#39;s really comfortable to sleep until 9 o&#39;clock in the morning. Sleeping is a 
kind of enjoyment, especially when you want to wake up.<br>
<br>
After reading a dream of Red Mansions (II) today, I didn&#39;t see any good. It 
doesn&#39;t seem to fit my heart. When talking, I said: &quot;in the final analysis, 
people are for themselves, that is, selfish.&quot; One is material, and the other is 
spiritual &quot;comfort to the soul&quot;. How to understand Jiang Suping&#39;s words of 
selfishness is also for him, mostly for himself. When it comes to future 
aspirations, I used to be a writer. Jiang Yun was a writer = = experience + 
genius. I think so, but reading should also be a little. Genius, I don&#39;t know if 
I have, but what about experience? I want to expand.<br>

In the afternoon, my roommates and classmates went skating with some girls. I 
watched Bajin&#39;s &quot;home&quot; alone in the dormitory. My heart was very melancholy, but 
also inexplicably melancholy. What should I do? After dinner, I talked to 
tangjinghua and felt much more comfortable.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I listened to the report on the &quot;Cultural Revolution economy&quot; 
and Mao Zedong&#39;s countermeasures. I also went to self-study and saw &quot;home&quot;.<br>
<br>
After self-study, I went to pull the single and parallel bars, straightened my 
back, and practiced in the future! I&#39;m a little homesick today. Mom and Dad, I 
love you.<br>

In the evening, I received a letter from wangbeiyu. He sent me color photos. I 
felt very good. I was very happy and confident.<br>
<br>
I wrote four letters today, qinbin, Ju Hongcheng, wangbeiyu and Daosheng. Now I 
feel blue again. I don&#39;t know what the outside world has changed me. When I went 
to bed at night, I gave a woman a five point scale and a 100 point scale for the 
first time. It was very interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the afternoon, I read Freud&#39;s psychology of love, but I didn&#39;t find it good. 
It was my first time skating with jiangsuping and Dai Weiyang. Go to Wutaishan 
gymnasium. I can skate fairly well. I couldn&#39;t walk a step at first. Finally, I 
went to the arena. I fell down seven times. I didn&#39;t feel much pain. But when I 
slipped away, I was taken over by others. It was very painful, but I was very 
happy. I must learn more in the future and completely revolutionize myself.<br>
<br>
In the evening, Lin yueen took some &quot;Girl Diaries&quot; and showed them to several of 
us. It was my first time to see this kind of thing. I was very curious and 
fascinated. The description of sexual intercourse on it was very pleasant. This 
time, there was a thing in the world. The woman, the daughter of water, I 
couldn&#39;t help but go back.<br>
<br>

In the morning, I went to the Chinese reading room to read the collection of 
papers on the true story of ah Q.<br>
<br>
In modern Chinese class, teacher jiangqinhua gave me a note to borrow reference 
materials.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I received zhengbaoxin. He blamed me for not answering the 
letter. In fact, I wrote to him first, and he replied to me. This time I have to 
write again. What is the end of the cycle. When I came back from the philosophy 
class, I walked with zhengrenxiang and Dengjin. I felt uncomfortable and wanted 
to hide. I walked with Lin yueen. After a while, Dengjin stopped and waited. I 
thought who she was waiting for. I didn&#39;t care. I didn&#39;t want to. When I came to 
her, she talked to me. She didn&#39;t say anything. Zheng asked the monitor&#39;s name. 
I said &quot;shixiaoye&quot;. Deng asked him to go to the Department building office for a 
meeting at 4:30. Wang Yingguo had asked her to go, Because she and Zheng bought 
movie tickets, Zheng asked me if I had seen &quot;W&#39;s tragedy&quot;? I said no. did you 
review the introduction to Literature? I said, &quot;no, I can deal with it in two 
days.&quot; she said that hexianmei wrote her a letter saying that something in 
English didn&#39;t come. I said that I also wrote a few letters to them. I didn&#39;t 
blame them. I wanted to say that I was clumsy again, so I walked away quickly, 
and with Lin yueen, there was a smile behind their backs. But shixiaoye never 
came back, so it was hard to follow her fate.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the Chinese newspaper reading room, and then every 
day. There are so many lectures, various associations and small blackboard 
newspapers in Nanjing University. I should make great achievements in this 
period.<br>

In the morning, I went to the reference room to borrow materials from Mr. Xu. 
Mr. Jiang asked for them, but he didn&#39;t borrow them. He said that he had lent 
them to level 85, but he still hadn&#39;t returned them. I had to go to urge them. I 
went at noon and didn&#39;t see them. I left two notes for chengshiqing, wanghaibo 
and jiangqinhua.<br>
<br>
At noon, in the writing class, Dongqin said that he thought it was a girl after 
reading my article, and got 90 points this time.<br>
<br>
Bring the loan form to Liu Yuan in the evening.<br>
<br>
When the Xuetong news agency held a meeting, I decided to be a reporter in the 
Library Department, and issued a new press card to be a formal reporter. After 
that, submit a press release every week and re score. Went to the reading room 
again.<br>

flipped through the books.<br>

In the afternoon, I went to self-study and reviewed the &quot;Introduction to 
Literature&quot;. After a talk with tangjinghua, zhengrenxiang came back and stood by 
the tree, unable to carry anything. I helped her and she took it away by herself 
at the door. After receiving xuqun&#39;s letter, he sent a letter to Guan Hong.<br>

After sleeping for the afternoon, I received a letter from Daosheng and Guan 
Hongxin, saying that she would come to the cloud on November 9. I was at a loss. 
She said that she had something to say. She bought the moon and birds on behalf 
of her. She said that she had seen it and had something else to do. I was 
waiting for an interview.<br>
<br>
Two more loan application forms have been filled out and sent back.<br>

I slept all afternoon. Alas, I slept all day and still had no spirit.<br>

<br>
In the evening, when discussing Ah Q, many people took the stage and made 
speeches, but I was not interested or experienced. I was afraid to think of 
myself. Let&#39;s be a spectator. Go to sleep late and think about yourself. It&#39;s 
very poor. There is no such thing.<br>

The modern Chinese class is worried about the class representatives. After 
reading &quot;home&quot; today, Juemin and Jianyun, I am Juemin. In fact, I should share 
his mood, but I am really a Jianyun.<br>

I didn&#39;t attend the intensive English reading class today, so I can&#39;t cope with 
it. This should be a warning and preparation. I borrowed the romance of the Tang 
Dynasty and went to the street to eat small steamed buns. In the afternoon, I 
went to the street to buy a book for Guan Hong, but I went to a big bookstore 
and a small bookstall. There was no book, so I gave up.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to study by myself to see the romance of the history of 
the Tang Dynasty. When I went to study by myself, shixiaoye bought me oneortwo 
dumplings. I was tired and hungry all day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
This morning, when Guan Hong didn&#39;t come, he wanted her to come, but he was 
afraid she would come. What&#39;s wrong with the future. In the afternoon, he and 
Tan Derong went to Huaping. They held a sports meeting and watched it for a long 
time.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the afternoon, I borrowed volleyball and practiced with Dai Yong. On the 
wall, it turns out that practice makes perfect.<br>
<br>
In the late reading of works, Lu Xun put forward that the nation is 
fundamentally inferior, the nation is hopeless, and goes to the grave. Xu Qiang 
talked about the conversation. I just met him during the physical examination, 
but I became a friend. It is a coincidence that he will sleep in my dormitory 
after he talks.<br>

In the morning volleyball class, the teacher said that my passing was OK and my 
spike was good. Tangjinghua also played basketball.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I studied by myself with jiangsuping to preview English. I must 
review it in the future. Watching the romance of the history of the Tang 
Dynasty, the self-study is not as good as sitting in the dormitory, and the girl 
is sitting next to her. Her soul is also interested. In the evening, five sets 
of modern Chinese reference will be distributed to girls, including two sets of 
Dengjin, two sets of Cheng Tonghua (transferred to SHECHANG) and one set of Yan 
Ling.<br>
<br>

In the morning, I learned a lot in intensive reading class due to preview. In 
the afternoon, I went to the party class and did a good job. The two extremes of 
folly: blind obedience and rebellion. The party needs me, I need the party. That 
made me want to join the party.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the reading room for self-study, flipped through 
magazines, and tore off a small piece of W&#39;s lower body for the first time. It 
was very soul flying.<br>

<br>
In modern Chinese, Mr. Jiang asked a question.<br>
<br>
-----It filled my heart with poetic feelings ----- let Du Jing go up to divide 
the phrase level, and she drew ------ filled my heart -- (my heart) -, Jiang 
asked the two students whether they were right, and they both agreed, and said, 
&quot;class representatives&quot;. I didn&#39;t know what mood to stand up, a little happy, 
but also afraid. Because of different views, I thought it would be wrong to ask, 
so I denied it, and put forward ------ to make me ------ (my) heart full of 
------, Jiang Yun agreed with me, I am very happy. Rose has always been see me, 
he see her, she stops. I am so happy.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I had a discussion with graduate students. They said that they 
should read more books, use the library, participate in community activities, 
and live a regular life. I will. A graduate student of modern literature in 
Liyang named zhuyimin said that associate professor xuziying was a tolerant 
person.<br>
<br>
I received three letters today, Wang Beiyu, Ju Hongcheng and sunzhaopin. I think 
I should write a letter too.<br>

It is windy and rainy today. In the morning, go to the Chinese teachers&#39; reading 
room. Cheng Shiqing did not come, Xu teacher tell me to copy the registration 
number. After taking a nap at noon, I felt very comfortable.<br>
<br>
After class in the afternoon, I went to the girls&#39; dormitory to register. Dai 
Weiyang accompanied me, but he slipped away without entering the door. Yan Ling 
was very enthusiastic and asked me to go in and write. But Liu Linlan pointed to 
the bookshelf for a while. They were all indifferent and cold. After registering 
for 107, chengtonghua was also very enthusiastic, but he even asked me whether I 
was Dai Weiyang or Ge Yimin. I was not angry and said &quot;the next one&quot;. After 
registration, she said thank you. I said thank you. This is my first time to go 
to the hostel alone.<br>
<br>
Shixiaoye asked me to go to the reform through labor farm of the fourth machine 
tool factory tomorrow and paid 1 yuan. I think I should exercise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and fifteen<br>
<br>
I got up early for the first time in the morning and had to go for an interview.<br>
<br>
I took a bus to the fourth machine tool factory (the 11th reform through labor 
team of Jiangsu Province). First, factory director Jiang introduced the juvenile 
delinquency, then talked with several prisoners, and visited the prison -- a 
squadron dormitory. Most of them committed hooligan crimes, but also economic 
crimes, and could be sentenced to very heavy sentences, 10 years, 15 years, with 
a suspended death sentence. Dai Weimin, a 34 year old Party member from Subei 
oil field, was sentenced to 15 years for hooliganism. It&#39;s easy to say. After 
lunch, it was not rich, and the food was not delicious. So I took the bus home. 
First, I took the bus to Pukou. It was crowded to death. My PG arrived at the 
alternative PG, which was very comfortable. Later, shixiaoye said that his DG 
arrived ~~~~~~~~~~. In fact, I used to cross the river by ferry in high school, 
and then took a car. This time, I arrived at another PG by DG, which was very 
comfortable. In fact, it was not very crowded. Both sides could avoid it, but 
she didn&#39;t want to. Maybe she felt the same way, so she kept close to me. Later, 
I knew her intention, and I was bold and tighter. I put my hands on her legs, 
pushed her back, and stroked her gently. She also ignored me. When I got out of 
Gy, she also shook her body for a while, and both sides were willing to listen. 
Because I had only one cent, I wrote a letter home, which cost 20 yuan. Wrote to 
Guan Hong, xuqun and Wang Feng.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and sixteen<br>
<br>
After receiving a letter from home, I sent 40 yuan. I was so moved that nothing 
could be better than home. Alin bought a ski shirt (vest combination) for 33 
yuan. I&#39;ll buy one in the future, but it&#39;s better. At noon, Zhang Weimin said 
that a girl and zhengrenxiang arrived at No. 11 dormitory. He said that it was 
Guan Hong. I was at a loss. Later, he said that I wore glasses. I guessed that 
it was duxiaoyan. Later, he didn&#39;t. (I later learned that it was Dai Xiangjie)<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, we were doing composition in the dormitory. Suddenly, we heard 
a ns voice. I said that NY was coming. Zhang immediately opened the window and 
put his head out. I also pushed the window. Alin and I put our heads out. 
Everyone laughed.<br>
<br>
After watching the movie &quot;W&#39;s tragedy&quot; late, I felt very good. I thought of me, 
women, life and stars. Is it really a tragedy?<br>

In the morning, I went to Yan Ling&#39;s office to register. Only one woman was in 
the dormitory. After registering, I went to the reading room with ah Lin and 
registered with Mr. Xu. There were 33 modern Chinese reference materials. Took 
40 yuan and bought 3 yuan woolen pants.<br>
<br>
The lesson of reading works talks about thunderstorm. It&#39;s really good. It&#39;s a 
drama. I&#39;m determined to read more classic novels.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s fun to play fortune telling and word testing games in the evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and eighteen<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to study by myself with Alin. Because I wanted to take an 
examination of introduction to literature, I looked for a seat for a long time. 
I wanted to get close to NY, but I often couldn&#39;t. later, I found a person to 
sit down and read a book. I couldn&#39;t see into it. I scratched for a while, wrote 
a few pseudonyms &quot;Yimo&quot;, and came out to the library. I didn&#39;t have a student 
card, and then came down to eat a bowl of small wonton.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and nineteen<br>
<br>
In the morning, I began to do an exercise in English extensive reading. After 
the preview, I still did it, but I didn&#39;t pay it in time. I waited another two 
weeks.<br>
<br>
Introduction to Literature: two questions: 1. Write an outline; 2. Write an 
examination paper. This is also the first exam.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and twenty<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to listen to the report &quot;the history of lawlessness&quot; with 
Shi Xiaoye (zhuyonghe, a graduate student in the Department of philosophy, gave 
a lecture), saying that in China&#39;s history, there was no legal system and the 
power conferred by society on citizens. Wutian: natural human rights are not as 
good as those in the West. Today, a whole set of western culture should be 
introduced to collide with China&#39;s traditional culture to produce a new culture. 
Later, he talked privately with several people about China&#39;s backwardness and 
the root causes of the national evil. Deng Xiaoping said: the party and the 
government must be separated, the party and the government should be divided, 
appropriately divided, and the party should lead the government. And we should 
seize the &quot;economy&quot;.<br>
<br>
He also said that zhangchunqiao saw the &quot;economy&quot; and beat down the old cadres. 
Mao Zedong could not see it. He was surrounded by the &quot;good situation&quot; and 
became a poet. Deng Xiaoping developed the economy of Hu and Zhao and balanced 
politics by himself. Zhu tongsherenyun should carry out the cultural revolution 
again to save China. Zhu Yun first argued for freedom of speech.<br>
<br>
Is China hopeless? I thought of Lu Xun, but I should surpass him and take out my 
pen.<br>

I received Guan Hongxin from self-study. She said that someone told her that I 
had changed, but she firmly believed that she had read me right. What do you 
mean? I didn&#39;t know what to say. I just wrote a few letters to a girl. Of course 
I am me, but what should I do to her? She pasted the stamps upside down and 
pasted the envelopes by herself. She also said that some people scolded her for 
going to &quot;enjoy&quot; her admission to Nantah next year? Of course, I just want to 
thank the first girl who wrote to me and sympathize with her. She is not 
beautiful. I don&#39;t love her at all. Of course, I am not a mediocre. We are still 
classmates or friends.<br>

In the afternoon writing class, Dongqin said that he should not criticize 
minister Bian too much. In the class, only &quot;Ge Yimin&quot; was not the case. 
Daiweiyang said &quot;Rose see you&quot;. I was very happy. I got 90 points for the 
composition.<br>
<br>
Study by yourself in the evening and prepare for intensive English reading 
tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I went to listen to ligusan (LiuHaisu&#39;s graduate student)&#39;s &quot;my view on Chinese 
painting&quot;. It was OK.<br>
<br>

<br>
At noon, Tang Jinghua visited and met Tan Derong again.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the Confucius Temple with shixiaoye and walked all 
the way. First, I took the bus to Zhujiang Road, but I didn&#39;t know where to take 
it. But I stopped and walked back. I met a policeman arguing with a cyclist 
about running a red light. I saw that DG arrived at a PG, which was very 
comfortable. Then I changed to an old man, who didn&#39;t know at first, and then 
felt sick. He wandered along the road. After the tickets for the thirteen 
maidens in Yan&#39;an ran out, I walked to Xinjiekou, went to the department store 
for a walk, and finally got to the Confucius Temple. First, I went to the shops. 
The buildings were made of wood, painted beams and carved buildings, and each 
shop had valuables. Then I spent 20 cents to enter the daxionmen gate, saw the 
exhibition, four county and district monuments, saw a lot of porcelain, and 
walked around inside.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to a restaurant and ate dried silk, potstickers, and powder. 
Later, I went to the Qinhuai cinema and saw the blood splashing screen. I was 
surrounded by a ny who was beautiful, fragrant, and coughing all the time. I 
felt pity for her. My soul flew away. She had a boyfriend. I didn&#39;t dare to be 
presumptuous, but when my feet arrived, I would die. If it were for me, alas!<br>
<br>
After taking the bus, I arrived at PG 1, a junior high school. It was fun to 
hide while entering. The latter one is charming and coquettish. My DG is even 
more exciting and fun.<br>
<br>
When I came back, Dai Weiyang talked with pengxiaofeng, and I made up my diary.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Slept all morning.<br>
<br>
At 2:00 p.m., I went to Jiming temple, walked to the drum tower, visited the 
store, took a bus to Jiming temple, arrived at the DG on the bus, one was pasted 
all over the body, and my nose was inserted into my hair, so fragrant. Get off 
and go to Xinhua bookstore. Read with one arm for a long time. When I went to 
the temple lawn, I saw that many people had arrived. Here is the foundation 
stone laying ceremony for the poet&#39;s corner. I saw that zhangweidong and 
sunxiaoshi of the news class had also arrived and filled in the registration. 
The host was Chen Ling, a young and beautiful girl from the political group of 
No. 42 middle school. After a while, many people came. Most of them came to 
Nantah. After a talk, it rained, which added to their poetry. When the yellow 
cloth covering the poet&#39;s horn pole was lifted in the rain, several people made 
a speech to revitalize Nanjing&#39;s poetry circle. Later, they went to Jiming 
temple every Sunday afternoon. In this poem, I think it would be nice to have a 
NY, but they all have men and girlfriends. There is a single middle school 
student. I want to talk with her first. She has been listening to the speech for 
a long time. I can&#39;t wait for her to come out. Then she greeted me. I summoned 
up my courage and said &quot;hello&quot;. With a giggle, my heart went to hell. After a 
long time, I was so upset that I had to give up. What a person I am.<br>
<br>
Later, I took the bus to Gulou, then Changjiang Road, and then Zhujiang Road. 
They also arrived by DG. They were hard to say anything. Some didn&#39;t care, some 
just moved away, and some moved to a different place. At that time, I lost my 
mind and only knew revenge. When having dinner, she ate with the moon. She had 
great manners and looked at me. The heavy rain wetted my suit, washed the boiled 
water in the rain, and broke up in the dormitory. After watching the movie 
&quot;looking forward to Lang&#39;s return at night&quot;, I sat with a NY. First, I leaned 
against her. She hid for a while, and then I didn&#39;t care. I leaned against her. 
DG was hard. She was so bold that she trembled her legs and legs with her hands. 
She ignored me. I touched her legs with my hands. She glanced over her head and 
scared me out of my hand. I didn&#39;t dare to take a step beyond the thunder pool. 
I was also disciplined. The film was made in the 1930s. It was naive, but 
innocent. The plot also moved me.<br>
<br>
I went to the library, didn&#39;t have a card, came back, and watched TV for a 
while.<br>
<br>
Today, the best and the ugliest are together.<br>

Zhang Weimin woke up in the morning. It was already 7:20. As it was the modern 
Chinese class, he quickly put on his clothes and ran to Beiyuan. He didn&#39;t wash 
his face and mouth. He just combed his hair.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I listened to &quot;one family in the world&quot;, a video player. After 
receiving sun Guanghai&#39;s letter, he asked me to play. It was difficult to be 
gracious.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know why, I have a little trouble in my heart, even in the reading 
class, alas. No, I was at the time of reform. In this great reform, it was up to 
me who I was. I was about to reform myself. Everything was a small matter, and 
the great cause ZZ decided everything.<br>
<br>
Reformers should live with laughter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and twenty-five<br>
<br>
Today, I had a haircut, took a bath and washed my dirty clothes. In the evening, 
I listened to the report &quot;reform trends of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe&quot;. 
It&#39;s really cold today, and so is my heart. A reformer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and twenty-six<br>
<br>
It was very cold in the morning, and my heart was a little sad. I learned 
English.<br>
<br>
After lunch, when I opened the door, I saw the same Buddhist monk looking at me 
in a strange way. It was a little strange. I saw a man wearing a white 
windbreaker. It turned out to be my brother. He was smiling at me. I called him 
&quot;brother&quot; for the first time. So he sat down and talked. He had been in Nanjing 
on business for ten days. After a talk, he took a bus to Xinjiekou. He bought 
two books about building materials. Then I went to Zhongshan Mausoleum by bus. 
Climbing the 299 steps (counted by others), there are several gates and walls of 
&quot;fraternity&quot;, &quot;the world is the public&quot; and &quot;noble righteousness&quot;. Inside, there 
is a round arched tomb. Sun Yat Sen, with porcelain stone and white marble lying 
on the porcelain coffin, is awe inspiring. After coming back and eating 
dumplings, he went to hongjiwu to have a talk with fankexia. He wasn&#39;t there. He 
talked with pengxinhai for a long time. When he came back, he went to bed with 
him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand one hundred and twenty-seven<br>
<br>
Today, my brother got up first. I got up too. After washing, I went to breakfast 
with him. After that, he bought me some oranges. He took a bus to Xinjiekou on 
Zhujiang Road, then went to Yuhuatai and returned to the internship factory. He 
bought oranges and put them in his windbreaker bag. I waited for him outside the 
school gate, just like the &quot;back&quot;. I really appreciate him. He asked me about my 
winter clothes. I said to get them at home first, and then told him to buy them 
again. He said he would send me 30 yuan back. I said the loan was coming down, 
so I told him not to send money. I don&#39;t know how to treat my brother when he 
comes and goes. I&#39;m tired, melancholy and cold these days.<br>
<br>
Wrote to Guan Hong and sunguanghai.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, Hua Ping and Tan Derong came to have a talk.<br>
<br>
Face reform and life with a smile.<br>

I&#39;m in a bad mood these days. I&#39;m very melancholy. I&#39;m just like Wang Wenxuan 
when I watch cold night. It&#39;s very cold. Maybe it&#39;s because of this (the same is 
true for senior three). I&#39;m very cold in my heart. I&#39;m a little worried. I want 
to sleep for no reason. I&#39;m very worried. I&#39;m not bothered for a moment. I go to 
class, sleep (when I sleep), and eat. Alas, can&#39;t I get rid of it?<br>
<br>

In English intensive reading class, due to misunderstanding, I didn&#39;t read high 
enough. I thought it was wrong. The teacher said to daydream -------- daydream, 
quiz, not at all. After reading Zhang Weimin&#39;s, I did it for a month -------!<br>
<br>
I received a letter from Tao Sheng, asking me to buy a digest card.<br>
<br>
I had a big sleep in the afternoon and borrowed corrosion to watch. At 5:30 
p.m., I got into bed and suddenly heard a female voice outside the door, &quot;is Ge 
Yimin there?&quot;, I don&#39;t know who it is. I doubt my old classmate. Who did Zhang 
Weimin say? I hurriedly put on my shoes and went out to see a woman. It was Guan 
Hong. I called her name and asked her to come in and sit down for a while. Only 
then did I see her clearly. She was still fat, with a waterfall to her 
shoulders, but it was ok with too many clothes. After the greeting meeting, I 
went out with her, went out of school, went to the cinema (victory), and talked 
with her all the way. I remembered that she hadn&#39;t eaten, but couldn&#39;t find a 
store. When I went to the cinema, I bought a ticket for the thirteen chivalrous 
girls. The ticket was 55 cents a piece. I couldn&#39;t find it for ten yuan. She 
gave me one yuan, and I bought one yuan and eight apples. (I don&#39;t know what to 
buy). In the cinema, she cut me to eat one first. When she saw the terrible 
scene, she couldn&#39;t stop bowing her head many times, Especially afraid of 
snakes.<br>
<br>
When I arrived at the school, I asked to find zhengrenxiang, visited the 
playground, went out to Jinling Hotel first, and when they came back, they 
talked. I only broke in occasionally, but there was nothing to say. Then I went 
to talk to tan Derong again, and talked about going back tomorrow, and then to 
the bedroom. Then I thought I shouldn&#39;t talk to Zheng, so that I didn&#39;t have a 
chance to talk to her alone. But I was in a bad mood. I also told her to forgive 
me for being ill and cold.<br>
<br>
I talked with my roommate about her and me. Zhang Weimin and Chen Jing were just 
as redundant as me last time. Where are you going tomorrow? Xuanwu Lake? Nancai 
Mochou Lake. I am blue and afraid again. This is my first time with a girl.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Forced this morning. After waiting for them, I took them to breakfast, and then 
took a bus to Nancai. I still didn&#39;t talk much. When I got to Nancai, luoshouxi 
was called out by huangxiaomin. Unfortunately, we went to Mochou Lake and walked 
around. I was a little cold, trembling and had nothing to say. After returning 
to Nantah for lunch, Zheng went to 1She to write a letter. I had a separate talk 
with Guan, and they had a very good talk. She said that what jiangliping said to 
her was that I was arrogant and didn&#39;t talk to them. I was wronged. I was always 
indifferent to girls. She said, &quot;I look down on me even more&quot;, so she still 
forgives me.<br>
<br>
At this time, luoshouxi and huangxiaomin came, so I took them to dinner, came 
back to talk, made tea, and Guan Hong gave us card fortune telling. It was 
interesting about love cloud. After seeing huangxiaomin on the bus, he 
accompanied him to the station. When he met XURUI, he came to buy shoes and met 
a real kinsman from his hometown. Later, she told Guan that she was having a bad 
time. She said that her face was hanging like this at home. Don&#39;t be surprised. 
At this time, I was in a good mood. I read some English in the evening and went 
to the library to read Xuzhimo&#39;s poems. It was very good, too.<br>

go to the third canteen to eat noodles and a packet of shrimp soup. It was my 
treat. Later, they invited each other. I was a little reluctant. I had to stay 
up late every day. I couldn&#39;t stand it until 11 o&#39;clock. But it was very 
interesting. I had a few days&#39; food first and played volleyball in 
extracurricular activities.<br>

In the afternoon, Dai Weiyang went to the Institute of education to find 
pengxiaofeng. On the way, he talked about the shortcomings of the dormitories. 
The three of us worked together.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I invited the girls to have a party. First, I invited Wang 
Wenwen with Yaogang, then yinxiuping and fengqiuhong with Da Pao. I also invited 
Feng&#39;s two female classmates, one of whom was from Zhenjiang Medical College. 
Her name was huangyuanfang. She was very beautiful. Yao Gang brought a little 
brother to have a big meal. I did well for the first time, cheering, eating 
melon seeds and talking. I had a night of dancing, smoking, throwing bottles of 
wine, playing guitar and setting off fireworks. Later, Fengping, a girl from 
Huangshan, sang one song after another. She first looked at me and said, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know my name yet.&quot; I said, &quot;it&#39;s too bad to think about it.&quot; then Dai 
Weiyang said, &quot;long live Ge Yimin.&quot; she said she remembered, Ge Yimin, she 
taught me to dance, 14 steps, and said I was right, He taught me another four 
steps and looked at me several times. It was wonderful. Later, I said, &quot;thank 
you, Fengping. Long live Fengping.&quot; finally, at dawn, when she sang, I rewarded 
her with many balloons. Ah Lin finally invited her to dance. He refused. He 
looked at me, but I deliberately didn&#39;t invite him. Finally, I lost my voice and 
became a big star.<br>

I slept all day today and sent a letter to Guan Hong and her family. * I was a 
bit disgusted. It was a normal schoolmate relationship. Later, the dormitory and 
my brother said that she had that love. I didn&#39;t realize it. Now she has a 
little. She gave me a set of postcards. She thought she didn&#39;t receive them. She 
said that the postman was &quot;corrupt&quot; and was so dazzling. She sent me two 
calendars. She asked me to give one to tan Derong and deliberately publicize it. 
I sent the other one to Yiwen. I watched the movie &quot;Eagle over London&quot; tonight 
and bought cigarettes with xumin for the first time.<br>

In the morning, I was late for the introduction to linguistics class. When I 
opened my eyes, it was already 7:30. I got up and went. I didn&#39;t brush my teeth 
and wash my face. Only two boys were not late. Yang Xipeng was angry. I met Feng 
Ping on the way. It was so beautiful. In the philosophy class, the teacher told 
me the review topic and met him again. It was so beautiful.<br>

had a smiling face. The world is full of love.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I invited the cannons to eat tremella soup, and Alin asked me to 
buy glue. I didn&#39;t want to lean against it, so he thought I was afraid he 
wouldn&#39;t give me money. I also fired the fire, but it was OK to come back. I saw 
Xuzhimo in the evening. I received a letter from wangguofang, saying that I was 
at work.<br>

(Jinfeng) with Zhang Weimin, and ate two of them to my heart&#39;s content. I was 
very happy to receive Xuqian&#39;s letter this evening. She said that she was glad 
to receive my postcard, and was angry that I didn&#39;t write to her, and asked 
about the college student parade. I saw a lovely and beautiful girl in front of 
me. She had just been a sophomore in high school. She fell in love at first 
sight. She had been in love with each other for a year. She is the most 
beautiful of my classmates so far. She is the most ideal candidate. She could 
write to me. She was angry with me. I thought she was too happy. I would 
consider sending her a long letter tomorrow.<br>
<br>
At night, I lit a cigarette and went back to grade two. Looking out the window, 
I saw the boughs, the buildings were dim, and the lights were a little bit. It 
was so beautiful. I found it for the first time.<br>
<br>
Did I really fall in love for the first time? I&#39;m so happy that &quot;my heart itches 
a little.&quot;.<br>
<br>
I can&#39;t sleep for a long time.<br>
<br>
<br>

At noon, I sent Xuqian a long letter with three sheets of paper, saying the 
reason why the university students&#39; democratic movement did not reply to the 
letter and the brilliant life in the University. I want to change and quote 
Rousseau language. It is very affectionate, waiting for her reply.<br>

In the afternoon, I went to self-study with Alin.<br>
<br>
First, go to the lawn, lie down immediately, laugh, turn a few somersaults, 
which makes the woman opposite laugh. At that time, the blue sky and white 
clouds, the trees and ancient buildings, the woman, are so beautiful that the 
soul can be sublimated.<br>
<br>
After that, I went to the old museum for a visit.<br>
<br>
On the way, two women pretending to be fierce met chengtonghua and tangchaoyang. 
They nodded awkwardly. It was funny. Then I went back to the third floor and 
went down to the second floor. Then I went out on the first floor. I couldn&#39;t 
help laughing.<br>
<br>
<br>

In the morning, I took an examination of introduction to literature, which was 
good.<br>

yuan).<br>

In the afternoon, I had a good exam on writing. He sat down with Zhang Weimin. 
Later, he went to the building with me. On the way, I asked him to ask Lao Jiang 
for ten yuan on my behalf. He asked me to buy him a pack of cigarettes. I was 
willing. He said he had done me a great favor and asked if he would tell me. 
Later, I asked me the time. I looked at my watch and found that it had been left 
on the table during the exam. I was so worried that I didn&#39;t go to the 
classroom. I thought my classmate had given it to Mr. Wang Jizhi. Later, I went 
to the Department building to give jiangqinhua a note. He said that he had 
picked it up and gave it to me. For a while, I was happy. I lost 45 yuan and got 
it back. Then I went to the hospital to get Banlangen.<br>
<br>
I received Wang Qunxin&#39;s letter in the evening and replied to it with a long 
letter. Alas, Xuqian and Wang Qun, the people I dreamed about in the past, will 
also write to me. But how can I treat them during the winter vacation and later? 
Zhang Weimin took my message book and found that many girls were attracted to 
me. At that time, I was indifferent? What about the future? What did the old 
classmates say to me?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0113<br>
<br>
In the morning, I went to the Daxing palace to buy a piano string. For the first 
time, I didn&#39;t dare to give a monthly pass. When I came back, Lao Jiang gave me 
ten yuan and didn&#39;t tell him. I was embarrassed. At noon, go to jiangqinhua in 
the department meeting room. I went to the Protestant church to study. Today is 
my birthday (lunar calendar). It was so. Alas, I came back and ate noodles and 
tremella soup with Yao Gang.<br>

After reading the notes of the last two questions, I was highly skilled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0116<br>
<br>
Waiting for xuqianxin every day, I swore that whoever didn&#39;t believe in him and 
slapped him in the face. There was no consequence. I slapped him gently. Alas, 
it&#39;s time to come.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
0120<br>
<br>
Over the past few days, people have been asking me about the parade. I said that 
I had participated in it. Most of the class 85 and 86 went to see the lively 
clouds. Yangzi: &quot;I have a son, and I won&#39;t let him go to college&quot;, * * &quot;the 
cultural revolution is coming again&quot;. My family also said that I should be 
grateful to Deng Xiaoping. I said that I should not use personal gratitude and 
resentment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0121<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to Grandpa Shengwen&#39;s house and talked about the

In the afternoon, I went to luoshouxi&#39;s house to discuss the appointment 
tomorrow. I rode the car that Yicheng had just bought and spent 191 yuan on the 
long march.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0123<br>
<br>
Early, I went to Jurong with my father and luoshouxi. First, I went to Su fan&#39;s 
house and met my aunt (distant relative). Later, he and luoshouxi went to the 
high school supplementary class. Li Youwen, Wang Ling and fengqingrong said that 
they had changed a lot and could not see it. He went to Qin Bin&#39;s house again, 
and then went to find cuihui (who had already worked). Later, he went to the 
county and met Liu Hui. He was speechless. After waiting for a long time, he 
didn&#39;t see his old classmates. He went to the street again and went to a 
restaurant. It cost more than 4 yuan. After dinner, I went to Mr. Ji&#39;s home for 
a meeting. Then I went to the dormitory. On the way, I saw a woman dressed in a 
purple windbreaker and a woolen hat. She was very pretty. When I saw her stop, I 
recognized Xu Qian and asked her to finish the exam. She said to send a 
classmate away. I waved my hand, motioned her to go, and she left. I can&#39;t help 
but look at it and drift past it naturally. Later, luoshouxi said that she 
called out the word &quot;Ge Yimin&quot;. At that time, I didn&#39;t know what she meant.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to zhengrenxiang&#39;s house. When I was not there, I saw 
zhengrenxiang, jiangliping, Hong Xin, Guan Hong and duxiaoyan in the county. I 
couldn&#39;t bear to see Hong Xin talking with so many male classmates. When I asked 
when I would come back, I said &quot;it&#39;s eighteen.&quot; Guan laughed to himself. When I 
met her on the road, they all said hello. Later, luoshouxi said that she 
pretended to be ignorant and hypocritical.<br>
<br>
After that, I went to Mr. Ji&#39;s house and came back to see weiliming and Yinhua. 
I stopped and talked. Guan Hong managed to escape from the old age in many ways 
and behaved like a fool. Later, he went to mawenxiang&#39;s place with luoshouxi. He 
saw biqingyuan and a girl. They had a very close attitude.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I bought things with duxiaoyan, luoshouxi and Hong Xin. I bought 
four packs of cigarettes and went to the classroom. There were few people. At 
the party, I sat with Hong Xin and talked about the conversation. It was so 
happy. Lao Fu talked about communication. Lao Ji asked me to say, I said that 
they were marching in thought, studying novels, and just passing the physical 
education. They laughed. Although it was my birthday, I told my vassals 
DengLiJun and Xuzhimo about it. Liu Hui laughed and asked Zhang Aiqin to leave 
her address. She changed her name to Zhang Qi. Liu Hui said that I had changed. 
I said that it would be good if I changed. She asked if she liked Guan Hong the 
most. I denied that she had not liked it so far and would not like it in the 
future, because no one liked me. Later, she asked me if I had written three 
paper letters to Xu Qian. She and a girl (zhangqiaofeng) were reading letters in 
the corridor in the morning. They laughed and said, &quot;Lao GE has sent a letter&quot;. 
It was both a parade and a complaint. I said that writing a letter was my 
temporary vent. She said she had prepared a cake for my birthday and brought it. 
I was very scared. After that, they danced and played cards. Hong Xin told me to 
leave. I asked the manager to divide the cake into 16 portions. When they ate at 
home, they greeted each other one by one, and then joined Hong, duxiaoyan, 
jiangliping and other high school classes. Looking back in bed, I am so happy, 
Xu Qian, so beautiful, so beautiful.<br>

After waking up and eating fried dough sticks with old ma, he and luoshouxi went 
to zhengrenxiang&#39;s house. When they saw Hong Xin at the station, she bought a 
ticket (in the afternoon) and asked her to go to zhengrenxiang&#39;s house. She said 
she had an appointment with Xu Qian and asked me if I would go. At that time, I 
had a feeling about this. But I didn&#39;t say anything. I really wanted to go, but 
I shook my head twice.<br>
<br>
In the Zheng family, I met Zhang Aiqin and had a big talk. She shared many of my 
views on the current regime, bureaucracy, the Vietnam War, childhood anecdotes 
and her changes. Later, Liu Hui came. It was disgusting. She took two books with 
her. Later, she left and asked me to return them to Guan Hong. It was fun. I 
asked Zhang Qi what she meant, and she smiled. She was really cute, petite, like 
a water lotus that was too shy for the cool wind. Her face was beautiful to 
flow.<br>
<br>
After dinner, I went to Guan Hong&#39;s house to return the book, and then I went to 
Zhang Aiqin&#39;s house to have a big meal. Zhoudaobao, Tan Derong and luoshouxi all 
went there. Later, Luo and I went to the high school remedial class to send Ma 
and Bi to the car. They went to Tan Derong&#39;s house.<br>
<br>
I waited for a while in the senior supplementary class, but no one was there. 
Later, Luo said that Hong Xin and a man had come. It was Xu Qian. I was so 
excited that I shook my head and waited for her. Later, they came in. I said, 
&quot;wait for you to eat.&quot; they went to get something and came in again. Hong said 
that they went to her house on the third day of the third day of the lunar new 
year. I vaguely said that the day was not easy. Xu Qian always looked at me with 
affection. Later, they left. Luo and I went down to find old ma. It was really 
bad that I followed Xu Qian. She wore purple pants and gave off charming 
radiance, Beauty, beauty, beauty.<br>
<br>
When they saw Lao Bi, they left. It was the tenderness of Xu Qian&#39;s turning 
back. Later, old Ma also came and said that two boys had sent Xu and Hong to the 
car. I was very angry. Later, I learned that it was fengqingrong and a person 
from class 4. Send Lao Bi away and then go back. After Zhang Qi came, I asked 
Lao Ma to play with them, which made them laugh. I said: Lao Ma, I think you can 
play, and they laughed again. When I left, I got out of bed to see him off. I 
said that old ma couldn&#39;t get on the road. After a while, I left and went down 
the stairs. Zhang looked up and smiled goodbye. I was very happy.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to jiangliping&#39;s house and had a party. I took them to my aunt&#39;s 
house for dinner. My uncle was at home alone. After a while, Su fan came in. I 
called her sister. My uncle asked her to call my brother. She called me. Later, 
I called her sister again. Later, the three of us cooked and cut vegetables by 
ourselves. Later, my aunt came in. My cousin and I had a talk. After drinking, 
my cousin said a lot about the situation of the second machinery factory, and 
the fun of fighting in Huainan and escaping train tickets. Later, I said 
goodbye, I sent two packs of cigarettes, which were left over from yesterday.<br>
<br>
He went to bed late and slept with Ma. He said that many women like me. He 
listened to the girls, such as Xu Qian and Hong Xin. Is Xu Qian really. He said 
I despise Guan Hong. Yes, I don&#39;t love her at all. Hongxinzheng talked with 
fengqingrong. Alas, Xuqian, in the morning, Liu Hui asked me if I was good with 
Xuqian. I said &quot;good p&quot;, and she said that Xuqian told her that I was good with 
Xuqian. But why didn&#39;t Xu Qian answer my letter? I didn&#39;t say three words this 
time.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m so happy. I think of Xuqian and Zhang Qi (old Ma said that she was taken 
care of and was born in 66 years. I can&#39;t delay her). But can I see her 
tomorrow, Xuqian?<br>

and hujunning, went to a trick, ate melon seeds, and paid 50 cents. Later, 
President Wang of the county invited a meal at Huayang hotel. There were a lot 
of dishes. After finishing the meeting, he went to the station, got on the bus

I picked up a bunch of keys a few days ago and read the notice of finding things 
every day. It snowed heavily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0220<br>
<br>
The class has changed. Xuetong news agency also held a meeting. I decided to 
work hard this semester.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0221<br>
<br>
Two issues of &quot;poetry journal&quot; and &quot;poetry daily&quot; came. After listening to the 
speech &quot;long live understanding&quot;, they were at Wutaishan gymnasium.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0222<br>
<br>
Read the cautionary tale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0223<br>
<br>
After receiving Wang Beiyu&#39;s letter, he decided to reply to him. He said he was 
sad. I watched the world table tennis championships on TV in the evening. I also 
conceived a letter to Xu Qian. Looking at my diary, I found that I was in love 
with her in many places. I really fell in love with her. Although I also loved 
me, I didn&#39;t love her at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0224<br>
<br>
It&#39;s OK to play volleyball in the morning. After taking a bath, I wrote to Xu 
Qian, saying that the time was in a hurry, and that she was getting along with 
others with advantages, so I waited for her reply.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the reading room and saw Yu Dafu&#39;s &quot;she is a weak 
woman&quot;. It was so beautiful!!! In the meantime, I often leaned on the toes of a 
woman opposite me. I felt neither friendly nor aloof. Maybe they were interested 
in each other. My heart was full of excitement. I couldn&#39;t say the tension, fear 
and pleasure in my heart. I fell down in the clouds and rain, and the two joined 
together. Alas, I need both love and sexuality. I also have ideals. A person is 
complex, but &quot;do what you want&quot; can no longer be suppressed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0225<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to plum blossom mountain and walked a long way along 
the ancient city wall. I&#39;m glad to see so many plum blossoms for the first time.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to learn from the news agency and compiled a blackboard 
newspaper.<br>
<br>

Received a letter from Li Erqiao and replied to it.<br>
<br>
The woman in philosophy class is so beautiful. I have a good look.<br>
<br>
I went to see the movie &quot;trap&quot; in the evening. The plot was not very good, but 
it was OK. I climbed the door for the first time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0227<br>
<br>
After sleeping in the morning, Lu Wurong called the roll, but zhaojianchun 
prevaricated by seeing people off at the bus stop.<br>
<br>
At noon, I was reading the ten year history of the cultural revolution. Xuminjin 
said that he had contacted 300 copies of &quot;second sex, women&quot; in the publishing 
house, so I picked them up. He rode three wheels, I rode his bike, and I moved 
the book. It&#39;s more than 5 o&#39;clock when we arrive at the school. It&#39;s very 
smart. It&#39;s 3.4 yuan a copy. Some people say that we will sell it. The 
Department of economics and the merchant cloud. It was sold until more than 
11:00 p.m., and there were 35 copies left. Later, the money was a little less, 
14.6 yuan. Lao Zhang said that I was short-sighted, and Dai Da said that it was 
difficult to prevent domestic thieves. When I think about it, I know the truth. 
Xu is really mean. But I made money again. I was still very happy. It took me a 
long time to fall asleep.<br>
<br>
Today Fengping said, &quot;you&#39;re Ge Yimin. You&#39;re right.&quot; I can&#39;t afford it because 
of something. In the future, you should be more attracted to her. Alas, how can 
you say that.<br>
<br>
I went to Yanziji on Thursday evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0228<br>
<br>
I got up early and went to class. My English class is OK today. I will work hard 
in the future.<br>
<br>
At noon, I sold out all 35 copies. I took the money and didn&#39;t lose a cent.<br>
<br>
Today, there are only two so-called voters in our class. Wang Yingguo and Liu 
Yuan are not democratic at all and are very angry.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to Xuetong news agency to collect the ticket. I learned that I was 
going to Caishiji, Ma&#39;anshan, Anhui Province. I said that I would assemble at 
4:30 tomorrow (in the morning). I took a kettle and bought some sparkling wine. 
I dare not sleep at night, so I have to sit on the bed with my clothes and 
pretend to sleep.<br>

photos, took a bus to Caishiji, went to Taibai Lou and Taibai Yiguan tomb, 
climbed to the top of the mountain and took many photos. Later, I took a boat 
back to Nanjing, ran around on the boat and took photos. When she came back, Xu 
Min said that she only got 12 yuan for selling books. She was very angry. It is 
estimated that there is little hope for scholarships, and it may not be without. 
It is very unpleasant. She wrote poems.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0302<br>
<br>
In the future, I should plan to develop myself and stipulate several necessary 
things: practicing calligraphy, English, reading, writing poetry, playing ball, 
entertainment (bridge, go, dancing, etc.). Can you? I swear by my future: Yes! 
Late uncle came and brought a lot of fried rice candy. I should develop myself, 
again.<br>

<br>
I played bridge all afternoon.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the reading room and saw Yu Dafu&#39;s Mi Mi and some 
poems by Bingxin. It was good. I was really excited to see a woman walking in 
front of me and a hazy PG on the road. Pull the thruster and watch the second 
sex.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
19870304---0307<br>
<br>
0304<br>
<br>
I shouldn&#39;t have read extensively in the two sections. However, it&#39;s too 
comfortable to sleep. It can invigorate the spirit, condense the Qi, relax the 
tendons and nourish the brain.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, he played bridge for another 16 laps, and played against Alin 
for 50 o&#39;clock. Go to the college students&#39; club for a meeting and the school

will write more interview manuscripts. I will find hot spots and get out.<br>
<br>
I was very glad to receive Xu Qian&#39;s letter late at night (when I saw that it 
was her letter). I was excited for a long time before I opened it. I said that I 
was the first to write to her, but I didn&#39;t agree with the ugly Chinese. I asked 
her Princess Yuner, and said that Guan Hong&#39;s second brother had a car accident. 
I was really sorry for it. Xu asked me to write to Guan, but how can I write? 
Kuang never passed the letter. Alas, life is too hard.<br>
<br>
She also said to me that her Princess asked, Ao, doesn&#39;t she really realize this 
and said that I am happy to learn better.<br>

She played it. I coached her. Her clothes were close to each other. She saw it 
clearly. Then she opened another table. I played against Zhang Xing. I found 
that she was very good. Yes, it&#39;s time to get in touch with her. It took them 
all afternoon to go. We were so happy.<br>

Foreign language classes are ugly. In the ancient works class, the woman knocked 
on the partition wall and handed a note. It was fun. When I went to play table

Watch the brave Mihai in the evening and go with Dai Yong. The same woman next

the car flows into the distance in the twilight, and the scenery outside the 
window changes faintly. Come back, say that the teacher came and gave me a 20000 
word paper to copy. Can I copy my words? I have to interview the sports meeting

<br>
I hate bureaucrats so much, but the official in front of me seems to be 
obedient. Really. I am independent and indomitable. There is only me in the 
world. Everything is for my own use. Can it really be so.<br>
<br>

In philosophy class, I looked at the woman in the news class. She was a little 
more beautiful.<br>
<br>
According to Bi, Xu Qian and fengqingrong have close contacts. What should I do? 
Forget it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0424<br>
<br>
After watching the video &quot;sinking&quot;, it was like writing about me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0425<br>
<br>
I started playing go again. What shall I do for my English test tomorrow?<br>
<br>
&quot;Poetry newspaper&quot; is very good. Do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0426<br>
<br>
In the morning, I took an English test, watched Yangzijiang and mengqinghai, and 
played chess in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s OK to watch nightclub in the evening, Li Qun and Liu Wei.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0427<br>
<br>
In the reading of works class, I played go with Lao Zhang for only three 
minutes. I ran away, but it was too late.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0428<br>
<br>
Play go and smoke with Lao Zhang.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0429<br>
<br>
I didn&#39;t go to English class and came back to Dai Da to speak English 59. I was 
surprised. I really want to, but I should swear. Hou Lao Meng said he was lying 
to me.<br>
<br>
I watched go in the canteen three nights. It was an unprecedented event.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Philosophy class review, see Yi Fu again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0510<br>
<br>
I bought a red dress for 13.56 yuan, which is good.<br>
<br>
Disabled n women, crowded in the store, DG arrived at PG, really comfortable, 
life-long rest.<br>
<br>
I wrote a news for short frequency Kuai. Federal German go players came to our 
school.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0511<br>
<br>
Wearing red clothes, I found that many people were very happy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0512<br>
<br>
There was an audio-visual class. It rained, and I didn&#39;t have PE class. I met 
Deng DA in the rain. She was so cute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0513<br>
<br>
In the ancient works class, wucuifen said that yejialing had a lecture. I had a 
good sleep in the afternoon. I went to change my clothes and saw a couple of 
lovers kissing on the North Lawn. What was it like?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0514<br>
<br>
And Dai Da changed their sportswear.<br>
<br>
When I went to the lawn in the evening, I met Fengping and said to hand in my 
homework. Then Dai DA and Yangzi River walked ahead. I slowed down. Feng caught 
up with me. I was really happy. When I asked about self-study, I went to the 
reading room. When I asked if I would go to Wuxi, I went home. I asked Zheng 
Renxiang&#39;s high school classmate Yun how nice it was to have a girl.<br>
<br>
Went to the reading room and saw gone with the wind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0515<br>
<br>
It&#39;s boring and melancholy.<br>
<br>
What are you looking at? Not interested. After watching &quot;rosy clouds all over 
the sky&quot;, I was really moved. Qiaoshupei and yincaiqin, I don&#39;t have his level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0516<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the high school remedial class, but old ma didn&#39;t 
come. Unfortunately, Li Erqiao didn&#39;t see me either. A student in Xiashu opened 
the door for me, and then went to find biqingyuan. I couldn&#39;t help but bump into 
him. It was going to rain, so I went back to the high school remedial class. I 
went to Xu Qian&#39;s house for a long time. I knocked on the door for a long time. 
My heart was pounding and my face was flushed. I didn&#39;t know what mood or 
courage it was. When I saw a key on the door, I couldn&#39;t help but open it. Just 
when I opened it, a woman asked &quot;who is it?&quot; in a voice. In a panic, I closed 
the door. It sounded so loud, and then I pretended to knock. I was ugly. When I 
opened the door, I must have a bad face and couldn&#39;t speak clearly. I just said, 
&quot;is Xu Qian there?&quot; her mother must have had a bad impression, The damned smoke 
was in the red shirt. She wondered for a long time. She knew that it was Xu 
Qian, so she asked her to sit down and pour tea (I stopped). She said that Xu 
took an examination of Zhenjiang and went to Zhenjiang to try volleyball. She 
played with Hong Xin and talked for a long time. I left. When I saw Guan Hong, 
she failed in the preliminary selection. After that, Guan came and talked for a 
while, and then went back to bed. I was really tired. I regret how I came to 
Xuqian&#39;s house like this and was fascinated by ghosts.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning, after waiting for a long time, Li Erqiao came to Zhenjiang. Even 
though he didn&#39;t know each other, he said he would go to Zhenjiang. At 9:40, 
when he went there, I said he would eat tons of rice and go to a &quot;drunken 
paradise&quot;. He spent six yuan on food. He bought wine. It was like a rich man. He 
wanted Xu Qian to show up. After eating, he went to the teachers&#39; college. He 
saw Zhou Daobao and Hua Ting, and the others went out. When I went to the 
Education Institute, I didn&#39;t see anyone. I was so tired. I should regret it.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, Li Erqiao went back to Danyang to see wangbeiyu. He sent his 
sister away. After Li left, I decided to go to my brother&#39;s first. Just after we 
separated from zhoudaobao, we saw a woman saying &quot;Yo, Ge Yimin&quot; and looking up 
at Hong Xin. We were so surprised that we met fengqingrong. A woman was wearing 
a red and gray stripe and glasses. I didn&#39;t know Xu Qian for a while. I was 
stunned to know that it was Xu Qian. I said that I would come with Li Erqiao at 
noon. He left. I went to my brother right away and looked at me. Maybe I had 
been looking at her all the time. In my eyes, there was a gentle and charming 
look that I couldn&#39;t bear to refuse, I nodded at her. She seemed to smile and 
say goodbye. I found my brother, played go, bought food and wine, and ate it. 
It&#39;s good to have a brother. So he sent me to the teachers&#39; college. He saw Hong 
Xin and her boyfriend go to the movies. He said that Tan Derong was at 
hexianmei&#39;s place, met zhengrenxiang and biyunqing, and found wangbeiyu. He took 
me to the dorm where he knew Xu Qian had left. Ah, he was in such a hurry and 
didn&#39;t say a word. What was the fate? I regretted it. Why didn&#39;t he ask: &quot;when 
will you go home?&quot; I saw some photos in he su. There was a half inch photo of Xu 
Qian, wearing a white shirt, Baihui head, charming smile, so handsome. She had 
given it to fengqingrong and qinbin. Why didn&#39;t she give it to me alone? So 
beautiful, so beautiful.<br>
<br>
After playing cards, I was dictatorial, hooked, and consciously said a lot. I 
was a strong man.<br>
<br>
I will go home at 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I had a long talk with wangbeiyu in the 
evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0518<br>
<br>
When I got home early, I was very happy to see my parents and grandma. Taiwan 
has money again, onehundred dollars, or threehundred yuan. My uncle is much 
better off with hepatitis. I need to recuperate. My eldest uncle also has 
hepatitis and recuperates for a long time.<br>
<br>
When I returned to Nanjing in the afternoon, there was a long hair fluttering in 
front of me in the car. At first, my hair was blown by the wind on my arms. It 
was so gentle and beautiful. Then I kissed her hair and stroked it with my 
hands. My heart was very excited and my lower body felt moved. Women. I will 
cheer up in the future. After a long time of non-human and non animal life, it&#39;s 
boring. Woman, forget it. Develop yourself first. When there are admirers, you 
should be as beautiful as red pants.<br>
<br>
Take out the energy to learn go, learn English, study hard, take an examination 
of Peking University graduate students, and work hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0519<br>
<br>
Good morning. I want to sleep. I think of English. I get up and go to English 
viewing. Late, no seat, I went to the &quot;English corner&quot; to see English.<br>
<br>
I washed my ski shirt.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the reading room and read &quot;mourning the death&quot; and 
&quot;what to do after Nora leaves&quot; and their comments.<br>
<br>
The woman next door is very charming.<br>
<br>
Most of the girls wear skirts, and the exposed legs and thighs are very tempting 
to me. In the canteen, on the street, and on bicycles, everything is so 
fascinating to me. I am obsessed with it. I am obsessed with it. I have no 
girlfriend.<br>

<br>
I watched the TV series a dream of Red Mansions (Episode 11 and 2) in the 
evening and watched the live broadcast of &quot;China Hong Kong football match&quot; in 
the evening. Win 1:0 in the middle, and go out.<br>
<br>
To learn from the news agency and add new people, I, forget it, should have 
retired long ago. I should have my plans, words, English, poetry and graduate 
students.<br>
<br>
No longer mediocre, study hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0521<br>
<br>
At noon, I felt dizzy and had a sleep. I woke up at 2:15. Forget it. I missed 
philosophy class once. Later, I went to the reading room to read the commentary 
on mourning the death and went back to write my composition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0522<br>
<br>
The mood is suddenly bad again.<br>
<br>
He is powerless and has no master.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0523<br>
<br>
In the evening, I watched the live broadcast of the battle of the Medieval 
Women&#39;s volleyball team on TV and watched the game. My heart was full of games.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0524<br>
<br>
Naive heat.<br>
<br>
The Chinese team is fierce in badminton.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0525<br>
<br>
At noon, when I was having dinner, my shoulder inadvertently rubbed against a 
woman&#39;s breast. She immediately fell into a depression. She felt happy, soft and 
ecstatic.<br>
<br>
Summer is good, look at women, beautiful thighs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0526<br>
<br>
He served in sports volleyball and scored 90 points.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the reading room to copy the translation of Li Sao.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0527<br>
<br>
Late Lao Zhang&#39;s birthday.<br>
<br>
I bought a lot of things, spent three yuan on a big meal and drank a lot of 
wine. I felt that I was dying, so I stopped drinking. Lao Zhang was drunk and 
had fun. I vomited on purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0528<br>
<br>
In philosophy class, I saw the beautiful woman with watery flesh and bones. Her 
whole body was just right. Later, Xu Min said that her name was yangxiaowen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0529<br>
<br>
I started playing go again.<br>
<br>
After playing go for a week, the game was closed because the final exam was 
coming.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
nineteen million eight hundred and seventy thousand six hundred and four<br>
<br>
Tonight, I went to the classroom for my first time. I was teaching 220 and 
sitting behind a beautiful woman. What was that like. The heart swings and God 
shakes. But it&#39;s nice to read all the books. Several times, she put her hand on 
her back with trembling, and her heart was sweet.<br>
<br>
When I took a bath in the evening, I saw that there were two families with 
lights on in the opposite building. I looked at them and saw that two women took 
off their shirts and went to bed. Unfortunately, there were still sweaters in 
the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0605<br>
<br>
I went to self-study again tonight. When I saw Feng Ping, I nodded. Watched the 
video Yamamoto 56 (Part 1).<br>
<br>
A desire to go to the ladies&#39; room suddenly came into being. Suddenly, he was 
like a mad dog. Although he thought a lot in his heart, he still couldn&#39;t help 
temptation. However, after all, he was knowledgeable. He could not go to the 
southwest building or the southeast building without a chance, so he gave up. I 
just want to meet the desire to see a woman, but I can&#39;t.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
On Saturday afternoon, I discussed my personal summary. I said that Wang Wenyun 
was not a bad thing.<br>
<br>
When I went to self-study and teaching 206, two boys came to me. I was not 
happy. I went downstairs at 106 and sat behind a large woman. My flesh would 
overflow, but it was very sexy. I looked at her like this. She might feel it. 
Sometimes she looked at me and looked back. Then I looked down. Later, I saw a 
lot. Maybe they knew each other. I dared to touch her back with my hand. She 
didn&#39;t attack and leaned back in the chair. I just looked at her chest and her 
lower body moved. Later, he bravely wrote &quot;Miss, you are so beautiful. Make a 
friend, OK? Thank, Chinese Department&quot; on the cigarette paper. His heart was 
pounding, and his whole body seemed to freeze. I don&#39;t know for a long time. He 
gathered his courage, touched her gently, and gave her the note. She was 
stunned. She took it over, smiled, and then turned back to me and said, &quot;no, 
please forgive me.&quot; I immediately cooled my heart, and she shook her head at the 
table. Then I tried to touch her back with my hand. She went out for a while. I 
read her book and wrote &quot;Hulunbuir...&quot; She was originally from Xinjiang with 
earrings, so when she came, I wrote a note: &quot;you look like a native of Xinjiang. 
I grew up there. We are fellow townsmen, right? We will take care of each other 
in the future&quot;. She touched her back and gave it to her. She looked at it and 
seemed to want to write something, but immediately handed it to me and said, &quot;I 
am not from Xinjiang&quot;. I wanted to tell a lie, but I couldn&#39;t. I just touched 
her back occasionally. After turning off the light, the bell thought that she 
was gone. I thought for a while, followed her out, caught up with her, and said 
that she was from Xinjiang. A computer department told me, but she didn&#39;t laugh 
or answer me. I&#39;m really happy to be with her. After Shi Xiaoye arrived, I 
talked to him. He laughed and said that. I told him that she was a fellow 
countryman with an economy of 84. Then I went to the canteen for self-study and 
drank a bottle of beer. It was delicious. I came back late and smoked a 
cigarette. This weekend, I am so happy. I really appreciate that girl. Alas, 
it&#39;s summer. Every time I have a meal, I see the beautiful thighs of a girl. 
It&#39;s really happy for a disabled family.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0607<br>
<br>
I went to self-study at noon.<br>
<br>
After self-study in the evening, I had a desire to go to the women&#39;s room. I was 
like a mad dog. I patrolled the third floor of the new church for a long time. 
Maybe I didn&#39;t lose my conscience. I went to the southeast floor again. Before I 
got the chance, I went back. Alas, why am I so obscene? How could this happen? 
In the future, I will take care of myself. I have no female friends. It doesn&#39;t 
matter. I&#39;m still young. I have to enrich myself. I have my own beauty in the 
book.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0608<br>
<br>
In the evening, zhaojianchun came to have a heart to heart talk with 
jiangsuping. I listened to him. He talked about the hardships of being a 
monitor, the difficulties in dealing with the world, and writing manuscripts. To 
say I am happy, I should decide for myself: always be happy, read more books, 
write more poems, and practice in English. This should be my first task. I will 
stand by in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0609<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I went to the street and bought a pair of swimming trunks. 
They were too big. Later, I changed them with Xu min.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0610<br>
<br>
After self-study in the evening, I read a book on a big candle. When I went to 
bed, I couldn&#39;t sleep. Because I slept all afternoon and had a daydream, I came 
down to read a book again, smoked two cigarettes and read a lot of books. I 
didn&#39;t sleep until March 30.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0611<br>
<br>
I mended my sandals at noon.<br>
<br>
I bought a pen and brush this afternoon.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to the lawn with Alin, and now I am in a good mood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0618<br>
<br>
Yesterday afternoon, I went swimming in the swimming pool. It was so enjoyable. 
The girl wore a bathing suit. It was plump and beautiful. I went swimming again 
this afternoon.<br>
<br>
These days I saw the movies Spartacus and sister Poe.<br>
<br>
Late in the evening, Lao Zhang said that he had received a love letter. He 
looked very distressed. Alas, how about me.<br>
<br>
Can God and gods help me with my poems? Thinking about poems, I suddenly came up 
with a good sentence. I took a pen and a notebook and wrote two poems in the 
dark.<br>
<br>
I must succeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0619<br>
<br>
In the evening, I went to drink with pengxinghai, qinyibin and tangjinghua. I 
spent five yuan and drank two bottles of beer. I was a little drunk and vomited 
a little.<br>
<br>
After listening to them talk about the Chinese Department, should I be academic? 
We can&#39;t muddle along any longer. Youth is precious. We should read books well 
in the future. How about so many novels? Try to do well in the exam and write 
something later. It&#39;s time to be happy.<br>
<br>

I finished my reading assignment Wen Yiduo and Xuzhimo in the evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0621<br>
<br>
I was tired of reading in the afternoon. I made peace and won the second half of 
a bottle of yogurt. I went to take a rest in the evening and sat down behind a 
big girl. Unexpectedly, I looked aside. I had planned to go to the party, but I 
didn&#39;t go. I leaned on my hands and feet, shaking my soul.<br>
<br>
I read the blackboard newspaper &quot;college students&quot; on my self-rest. I read a lot 
of articles that were very central. I exceeded myself and made up my mind. 
Didn&#39;t Yu Dafu read more than 1000 novels in college?<br>
<br>

<br>
I had insomnia last night and fell asleep at 4 o&#39;clock.<br>
<br>
At noon yesterday, I received a letter from xuhaiying unexpectedly, and my heart 
could not be calm. I found her in the friendship dormitory of the South 
traditional Chinese medicine. I didn&#39;t know how I felt when I first met her. I 
was very uneasy and bowed my head. She talked about Stendhal and Rousseau for a 
long time. The next day, I asked her to see the film Red Sorghum. Sure enough, 
she came with a girlfriend hanqinfen. I was downstairs drinking with Wang Ling 
and Tan Derong. Later, they had a talk. They all knew the guitar. They were very 
happy. They watched the movie late. They were amazing. They borrowed several 
books &quot;half a man is a woman&quot;, &quot;ah, good morning friends&quot; and &quot;well&quot; to them. 
They said that they would attend Zhang Yimou&#39;s sitting conference at noon the 
next day. The next day (Sunday), Guo came again. I was very happy. Later, 
because I asked for a signature, he broke up. Don&#39;t want to receive a letter 
yesterday! She talked about the so-called kindness I gave her, which was sweet 
and fresh. At the end, she said that I went to the southern traditional Chinese 
medicine to gallop the clouds. It was so sweet that I couldn&#39;t sleep. The more I 
think about it, the more I wake up. The sweet, bitter and astringent cloud I 
don&#39;t know.<br>
<br>
I went there this evening and had a talk with her. I went to the boys&#39; office to 
make an appointment to play football. She said there was an exam. I asked her to 
take it, but she refused several times. She accompanied me around the campus and 
went out to Jiangdong gate bridge. She didn&#39;t take the exam and went to Mochou 
Lake again. Sitting opposite each other by the lake, I talked about religion, 
the future, music, past teachers, classmates and family affairs. I didn&#39;t go 
back to school until 9 o&#39;clock. I was very happy smoking and inserting my pants 
on the way. Several times when it came to the situation, I stopped and didn&#39;t 
know what to say. She said that you just came to ask if the mailbox was ok (I 
don&#39;t know why she learned about my 257 &quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\? When it 
comes to sending her back to the dormitory, I&#39;m afraid that if the man follows 
her, he will send me back again. I&#39;ll stop and slip back to Nantah. Has 
everything started?<br>
<br>
Next tutor May 5.<br>

<br>
I don&#39;t know why I think of a person these days ---- xudandan. It used to be the 
flower of high school. How are you doing?<br>
<br>
Today, I told Dai Laoer to go to Nanshi, but later he didn&#39;t want to go. Because 
the school&#39;s 5.20 Art Festival opened tonight, he wanted to run. I dragged him 
to go and took him by bike. First, I found his classmate tangxuemei, who was not 
beautiful at close sight, but had a big and wide mouth. I told her that xudandan 
was my fellow townsman, so she went to call, and we waited. After a while, a 
beautiful woman came down. She had tight blue jeans, a white Pullover and short 
hair. She didn&#39;t know her. It seemed that she was Xu. In the middle of the 
stairs, she looked down, full of shame and bowed. After the Tang Dynasty nodded, 
I said, &quot;are you xudandan?&quot; She agreed, and her eyes were numb. I said, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know you.&quot; with a smile, she smiled, &quot;I don&#39;t know you.&quot; so I told me that I was 
Ge Yimin, a Jurong man. Only when she was 86 in the Chinese Department of 
Nanjing University did she know that it was Nanjing University. She was one 
level higher than her in senior high school. So we asked them to watch the 
opening ceremony at NTU. Xu said that she had gone to the river and sea to 
dance. I asked who she was. She said that she was just a classmate who knew her 
last name. She also said that Tang would go to Nanjing University if she went 
there. It&#39;s not good to go alone. Tang hesitated (because he was watching a 
movie) and his second son, Mo Zhi, went there together. He walked side by side 
with Xu and asked her about her classes, classes and novels.<br>
<br>
When I arrived at Nantah, the torch started for a while. My second brother 
joined me. I watched outside with Xu Tang and stood side by side. Suddenly, I 
became tall and proud. Later Xu said that he would find Liu Hui, find Liu Hui 
with him, and watch the game together. Later, Xu said he would dance, so I went 
with Tang to wait for my second son. After they returned to the dormitory, I 
found Xu and Liu under the banner of the philosophy department and watched the 
fireworks. Later, Liu asked me to leave. Xu Dan and I were alone. We said we 
would dance in the open air. Because there were too many people, she said she 
saw a fellow student and went to Nanyuan. In Beiyuan, I told her to drink less 
soda and she was leaving. I am very happy to catch up with tangchaoyang and Yan 
Ling. She bought soda in Nanyuan. She said I was polite. She met the second 
child and Tang again. He took her back. I went to Nanyuan with Xu. I don&#39;t know 
why she didn&#39;t go back with Tang? At the end of the 11th dormitory, no one 
danced. It was almost ten o&#39;clock. She invited her to sit down. She said she 
wanted to go back. At first, she didn&#39;t want me to see her off. Then she went to 
the school gate. She said she would go to Beiyuan to see her off. I didn&#39;t want 
to see her off. I couldn&#39;t say anything more, so I went. She said goodbye, and I 
had no choice but to &quot;hum&quot;.<br>
<br>
After coming back, I regretted that I didn&#39;t go with her, so I borrowed Lao 
Zeng&#39;s bike and wanted to give it to her. There were so many people at the North 
playground that I couldn&#39;t find her after a long walk. After the show, the cart 
was waiting for her at the door. How I wish she would show up. After waiting for 
a long time, no one was there. Later, I saw a boy with a girl, Xu, with the same 
clothes and posture. I was very sad. I didn&#39;t know why I rode with him. I 
followed him like a movie and rode to the south. Later, when I arrived at 
Shanghai Road, I took off my coat and wore a T-shirt (for fear that she would 
recognize it). When I chased after her, I disappeared. I was very scared. I rode 
to Qishe desperately and didn&#39;t see her. At that time, I didn&#39;t know whether it 
was anger or love.<br>
<br>
Talking at night, I haven&#39;t slept for a long time. Alas, the woman in my heart, 
you are too arrogant. I am a mortal. Can I be immortal? I came up with the idea 
of writing poems without punctuation.<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning, I wrote a letter to Xu. I thought it was very good without 
punctuation. A piece of prose and a piece of poetry showed my admiration since 
my sophomore year in senior high school.<br>
<br>
Playing football with Dai Yong until 9:00 p.m. was a great pleasure.<br>
<br>
When we got back, we took a bus to Nanshi with shixiaoye. He went to find 
qinshaoping first. Qin helped me find xudandan. She went to Hehai to watch 
videos. When the roommate came down, I gave her the letter and forwarded it to 
Xu. She was very polite. She asked me to come and play. I said the same to Xu.<br>
<br>
I am very happy to come back by bus.<br>
<br>
Oh, xudandan, can you understand my feelings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
I took many photos on campus in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
I wanted xudandan to come in the evening, and then I went to tutor a child to 
teach fifth grade Chinese. It costs 1.5 yuan an hour.<br>
<br>
After coming back, he said that xuhaiying and hanqinfen had come and returned my 
four books. He wanted to leave a message and crossed it out. It seemed that he 
still had to borrow books. Maybe Haiying isn&#39;t beautiful. I didn&#39;t want to be 
with her. Alas, how good would it be to change xudandan?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
The film class saw the forest of world movies (hosted by liuhongqing), and the 
class talked about montage.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know why. After playing the guitar for a while, I went to the Southern 
Division to find xudandan.<br>
<br>
First, I went to Shengli and Yan&#39;an to buy movie tickets, but it was too late, 
so I went alone.<br>
<br>
Closer to home, more timid.<br>
<br>
To her dormitory, the janitor asked a girl to call her. After a while, she came 
down, wearing a white skirt, a long mini, a white pullover, and her hair was 
very delicate. She nodded to me first. I was a little flattered. At first, I 
wanted to invite me up, but it was stipulated that boys were not allowed to go 
up, so I went downstairs. She said she knew I had been here, so I walked out 
side by side. I asked her if she would go to Nantah. She said that she would 
take an examination of the history of revolution on Thursday. She had something 
to do tomorrow night. Today (Wednesday), she had to read a book. Otherwise, I 
would have to take a zero score if I didn&#39;t read it at ordinary times. I smiled 
bitterly and walked out of the back door side by side.<br>
<br>
I asked her to come on Saturday. She said she might have something to do. She 
could come if she had nothing to do. I said that I could call Qin Shaoping 
(Department of Journalism) to come with me. Along the way, she said, &quot;you come 
to invite me over to play.&quot; I didn&#39;t know what to say. Alas, she was so 
beautiful and arrogant that I couldn&#39;t get close to her. I wrote to her and 
said, &quot;I walked on your right side, and God walked with you.&quot; this time, it was 
on your left side. Talking about the movie &quot;chivalrous bones and heart&quot;, she 
said she didn&#39;t like martial arts movies. She hadn&#39;t seen any novels by 
liangyusheng. Alas, why did I continue talking? She said you read and I went to 
find Lao ma.<br>
<br>
The long fence came to an end. The beautiful woman was with me. The time was so 
fast. I walked in side by side from the front door. I was a little angry or sad. 
I was speechless all the way. When I came to 1She, I said I would meet 
qinshaoping and come together (if I had time). She said that she might not come. 
Don&#39;t shout, otherwise I would make people wait. She also said that she often 
played the piano in the piano room. I asked Zhang Xianliang if she wanted to 
read the novel. She said she had &quot;Good Morning Friends&quot; and &quot;half a man is a 
woman&quot; might be borrowed. I said I did, but she didn&#39;t say anything. Ah, girl, 
why do you open your mouth.<br>
<br>
She said goodbye again.<br>
<br>
Looking for old ma, I went back to Nantah without him. I was very sad all the 
way. Holding a tree and waiting for a car seemed like a tree also had a spirit. 
But the tree grew luxuriantly. I was not as good as that.<br>
<br>
After reading &quot;half a man is a woman&quot;, I found it very profound.<br>
<br>
In addition, the love monk Chang Hen Su Manshu (written by songyiqiao) is also 
very moved, which is also true of our generation.<br>
<br>

The reference book class applied for the summer internship &quot;the art of film 
director&quot; and did a good job.<br>
<br>
I watched Nanshan moon &quot;the customs of men and women in different places&quot;.<br>
<br>
Later, I decided: bodybuilding, English, guitar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, xudandan became a member of my film and television training class (I gave 
her and her companions free of charge) and the Nanshi consignment point for 
movie tickets of the military club.<br>

<br>
The diary has been interrupted several times. The reason why it hasn&#39;t been 
written down is nothing more than emptiness, loneliness, boredom and 
helplessness. In a word, there is nothing to write.<br>
<br>
Today, I picked up my pen again and started a long psychological journey. I 
think I am no longer empty. I am very happy. Really, I have been very happy 
since the beginning of school. I want to do what I should do. I chose the 
language college. I also want to learn foreign languages. I have become the 
Secretary General of the film association. I want to know the society and life.<br>
<br>
My mother, hanqinfen, xuhaiying and Jiang Bin all said that I am very good to 
girls close to me.<br>
<br>
Han Qinfen was so pure. She came to see red sorghum for the first time. Sitting 
in my dormitory, she had a quiet, round face, big eyes and elegant physique. 
Later, xuhaiying introduced her. Seeing my guitar, Han said she also had it. She 
played it for a while and began to talk. It was very nice.<br>
<br>
Later, I went to see a movie. Lin yueen and I gave them tickets. We crowded in 
to see it. When I came to our dormitory after the meeting, I borrowed some books 
and an umbrella for them. The lights were out. Han rang Lin was upstairs and 
didn&#39;t want to send them off. I took them to the school gate and talked all the 
way. After that, they refused to send them off and left by themselves. I&#39;m so 
happy. It was agreed to see Zhang Yimou the next day.<br>
<br>
At noon the next day, if we were in the college students&#39; club, there would be a 
lot of descendants. Han would feel very uncomfortable if he crowded in. I asked 
her to stand on a stool with me. It was really comfortable. Later, I asked 
wutianming to sign and Zhang Yimou to sign. There were too many people. He 
signed in the car, but he didn&#39;t squeeze up several times. He followed him to 
the school meeting. After returning, Han and Xu had gone back.<br>
<br>
Later, a letter came. I went to her place and sat down with her at Mochou Lake. 
I found that she was very vulgar, not like Han. Later Xu and Han came again and 
returned my book, but my tutor went. Later, they came again and asked me to 
borrow a car and camera. I asked zhangkaipei to borrow a car. Xu said that it 
would not be used this week and would be delivered next semester.<br>
<br>
Once, I bought two tickets for a concert at the Zhonghua cinema and went to the 
Southern Division xudandan. She said that she had already recorded the video, so 
she braved the rain to go to Xu Han. Xu was not there. When she saw Han, she was 
having dinner with two male fellow countrymen. I said the concert, and she said 
it was a pity that some fellow countrymen came from other schools. I was very 
sad, so I went to refund my ticket. If there is no fellow countryman, will Han 
see it?<br>
<br>
Another week, I borrowed a car from Yuli Nakamura to Xu. But the next day Xu and 
a classmate looked flustered and said that the cyclist was run over by a car and 
died miserably. They went to Nakamura and said they would accompany the car. 
Later, I accompanied her for 300 yuan. I gave Zhongcun 150 yuan and watched a 
movie with xuhaiying, but I was not used to it. I wanted to get close to her, 
but I didn&#39;t dare. I thought she was vulgar and ugly, but forget it. That&#39;s it.<br>
<br>
During the summer vacation, I found Hui Hui, who was absent for the first time 
and came to my old classmate for the second time, so we couldn&#39;t go to the 
movies with me and ate watermelon.<br>
<br>
God arranges no, that&#39;s it.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of this year&#39;s school year, I moved my bed and watched TV. Then 
Dai Weiyang and chenjintao ran for monitor. Chengtonghua said: little people 
play games and see through.<br>
<br>
Studied the Three Kingdoms and the water margin.<br>
<br>
Results: man proposes, God disposes.<br>
<br>
Do justice on behalf of heaven, and help others with their money.<br>
<br>
He had a very good relationship with shaving, Dai DA and Lao Jiang. The four had 
coffee with Cheng Tonghua once. On Dai Yong&#39;s birthday in the drum tower, there 
were preserved meat, cake, beer, coke and coffee.<br>
<br>
The next day, I went to the South Chinese medicine with Alin. Xu was not there, 
so I went to Han. They were very enthusiastic. They ate an apple, but they were 
very happy. I talked about war and the love between China, the United States and 
the Soviet Union. When I said smoking, Han asked, &quot;do you smoke?&quot; I nodded, and 
Han said to give me a bag. At a glance, ah &quot;more&quot;, super long 120! A woman&#39;s 
Lily cigarette is refreshing and beautiful after taking a sip. She said that she 
had overseas relations with Taiwan, Uganda and the United States, and her father 
engaged in township enterprises.<br>
<br>
Han Tai is very kind, warm and pure. Especially, I can talk about such a woman 
for the first time.<br>
<br>
She decided to invite her to the Gulou Cafe tomorrow night. She agreed and said 
she would come with xuhaiying. On the way back, ah Lin said he couldn&#39;t afford 
it. Just in time, I don&#39;t want you to spend it. Just spend 30 yuan each.<br>
<br>
The next morning, I decorated Yao Gang&#39;s room. In the afternoon, I went to the 
southern traditional Chinese medicine and brought Jin Ping Mei (Part 2) and Jiu 
Dai Shuang jiao (Gu Long). First, I went to Han and gave the book. She was very 
happy and called xuhaiying. Then I had dinner and apples there, and invited them 
to the Gulou cafe. I bought three: Allen cola, Nestle coffee, Italian ice cream, 
ice milk, preserved pork, preserved chicken, and a pack of halbang cigarettes.<br>
<br>
After eating, I went to Nantah to find zhengrenxiang and sunyong. In their 
absence, I went to Nantah to bring Han&#39;s angel guitar and said I would sell it.<br>
<br>
The next day I put up an advertisement, and I found a lot of books, such as Cen 
Kailun and gone with the wind, for Han. Han was very happy and cool. After 
sitting for a while, he smoked her more, which was really delicious.<br>
<br>
Redeem the guitar sold to xushuangxi and play it well.<br>
<br>
The next day, it was noon when I went to Han. Han returned the &quot;peerless double 
pride&quot; to me.<br>
<br>

This afternoon, when I went to Liu Yuan&#39;s place, Su Zhuping asked me to go to 
the southwest building 350 to sleep. Each person has a large room, and one yuan 
a night.<br>
<br>
In the morning, I (the Secretary General of the Film Association) went to 
Shuguang, Xuanwu and fuhougang with the second brother, and then went to Yan&#39;an 
to decide to charter the drummer.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I found zhushuguo, Lizhongbao and others.<br>
<br>
Luzhizhou is the vice president, engaging in outreach. Yan is Hilton, Shilin, 
and Nakamura&#39;s foreign exchange certificate (1:1).<br>
<br>
Zhou Jing, the leader of the fifth group of the film association, was found by 
Alin and I. she is from Nanjing. She is very delicate, short shawled and 
beautiful. Her companion Guodi is also very good. She is from Jilin and lives in 
8--107.<br>
<br>
After I moved to the southwest 350, I met Fengping, took her in, talked for a 
while, and lent her a guitar (angel hanqinfen).<br>
<br>
In the evening, I met Zhou Jing and Guodi again. In the afternoon, they came to 
play bridge. They were learning. The three of us went to the 350 of the 
southwest building for a meeting. They went to class. Then Lao Jiang and Dai 
Yong came. I told them about the meeting. I went to the classroom to call Zhou 
and Guo, and played bridge together. It was really comfortable.<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning, I met tangchaoyang and went to the southwest 350 for a meeting.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to Nan traditional Chinese medicine. I met xuhaiying first and 
sat down for a while. Libogo is really in great shape. Her face is also 
beautiful. She is fuller than xudandan without being fat.<br>
<br>
She asked hanqinfen to come over. She said she had classes in the afternoon and 
would take a bath at noon. I said I could find a way. She said she would not 
come alone, or I would bring her next time, or she and xuhaiying would come. I 
said I would deliver the tickets for the drummer on the 27th.<br>
<br>

Later, he went to the southwest 350 to play table tennis and took Guo Di to play 
bridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0926<br>
<br>
I went to the lawn to lie down at noon. It was really comfortable.<br>
<br>
When I saw duyuesheng, zhangxiaolin and huangjinrong of the Green Gang, I was

<br>
At noon, send tickets for drummer to hanqinfen and xuhaiying.<br>

<br>
There are ten tickets left. Arlene and I went to sell them.<br>
<br>
The second brother reproached me and Alin for giving Li Qing a ticket for Alin, 
and said that this was one time and that we would reconsider the formation of a 
cabinet next time. But he himself gave the official ticket to Wang Wenwen, Zhang 
Feng, etc. he was so narrow-minded that he had to do his own work in the future.<br>
<br>
Gave two tickets to Yuki Nakamura.<br>

<br>
Today, I want to go to the South traditional Chinese medicine again. I tossed a 
coin and went to the front. If it was the front, did God arrange it? If it is 
the opposite, I dare not think.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know how many days I&#39;ve been there. The excuse is to borrow and take 
books.<br>
<br>
When I entered the door, I met Xu and Han cutting pears. I went in to eat them 
and took melon seeds.<br>
<br>
They asked them to go to the movies. Han said he would go. Xu said &quot;you are so 
bad&quot;. Xu said he would go. As usual, the two dressed up for a while.<br>
<br>
At Shengli, I watched &quot;special envoy of the black flag&quot; and &quot;looking for a man&quot;. 
After watching the first movie, I played &quot;looking for a man&quot; (Han and Xu had 
made room for their seats when they left, and Xu was beside me). When Han was in 
front, Xu&#39;s hand was in his arm, and I reached out and touched it. Both sides 
shook. She did not take it back, so she slid down her legs and into the chair, 
and shook it for a long time. After a while, Han withdrew and let go. Then the 
three of them did, Maybe Han had found out, so he was very unhappy and fell on 
the front chair. My heart tugged. I liked Han Qinfen, but I shook hands with 
xuhaiying and felt sorry. Han also fell on the front chair.<br>
<br>
After the movie was over, I took the bus to accompany them back to the South 
traditional Chinese medicine, saying that I was taking gone with the wind.<br>
<br>
When I went to nanzhong, Xu asked me to wait at the corner, and she and Han went 
upstairs to get books. I ordered a good friend and waited. After a while, Xu 
came down. I was ready to ask, &quot;is there time tomorrow night?&quot; she said yes, but 
I hesitated. I didn&#39;t know what to say, so I raised my hand, motioned her to go 
back, and she went back.<br>
<br>
Just after we separated from each other, xuhaiying met Zhang Ziyi, a good friend 
of the friendship dormitory, and said hello. She walked outside with me to the 
side of a small tree. She stopped to touch the leaves. Maybe I walked too fast, 
and I lit a cigarette. He went to the stone chair and invited her to sit down 
for a meeting. Far away, he talked about something mysterious and mysterious. 
She asked, &quot;Why are you interested in her?&quot; she was afraid that old Ma had told 
me something about her, that she wanted to read more, that she was indifferent 
to love, that I was a child, and so on.<br>
<br>
She was invited to go to the lawn and lay down for a while. It was a little 
cold. When she went to the truck, the door wouldn&#39;t open. She went to the lawn 
again and said something mysterious. Finally, I asked in a trembling voice, 
&quot;dare you?&quot; At the same time, her trembling hand was put on her hand. She was 
silent. I stretched out my hand to hug her. She first lay in my arms, then 
twisted together, hugged tightly, rolled over, and for a while she panted and 
cried. She said she was thinking of someone else, but I said no matter, and 
thanked her. I hugged, pressed, touched, rolled, for a while I pressed her 
people, for a while she pressed me, and kissed, but her teeth touched her teeth, 
and her mouth had a strange smell, Then she stopped coming. She taught me that 
she had done it before, and I wouldn&#39;t let her kiss. Later, she stroked the 
breast, and she let me touch it, but didn&#39;t show it to me. After touching it for 
a while, she rolled around again. She stretched out her hand to untie my trouser 
belt, put her hand in, and pulled the penis. It was so hard that I felt happy 
for a while. But when the teeth touched, when she touched the breast, it wasn&#39;t 
very happy. Was it because she was too fat or didn&#39;t like her? I reached out to 
her trouser belt and put my hand in. I just touched the sparse pubic hair. When 
I stretched it out, I came across a damp and soft piece of meat that seemed 
superfluous. It seemed that there was still a mouth, but it was disgusting. So I 
retracted my hand, and her hand was holding my penis all the time. I hugged her 
and held her for a long time. Occasionally, I looked up and saw the lighted 
streets, familiar feelings and objects, and buried my head in her. At this time, 
reason had overcome feelings, and I could not distinguish between inside and 
outside. I was happy and sad, but the sad part was very moving. Later, when we 
agreed, we rolled around a few times to the same place, sat apart, and asked for 
a good friend. We didn&#39;t know why. She said she had expected it.<br>
<br>
Later, she went outside the classroom and said something. She said that I was 
looking for Han. She was a little jealous. Oh, and Han, how can I tell her in 
the future?<br>
<br>
Then he invited her to Nantah and hugged her shoulder all the way. It was an 
unprecedented joy and pride!<br>
<br>
After arriving at the southwest building, she entered my room. She played the 
guitar for a while and was ready to sleep. When I was sleeping in bed, she threw 
herself on the chair and invited her to come up. She said that was it. I helped 
her to bed. I was in the chair and asked to come up. She agreed with a smile. 
After getting into bed, turning off the light, she hugged Yi and said a lot of 
sad things. She said her so-called lover, sy, and asked me to drive him away 
from her heart. She said I look good, really? She said she thought it was good 
to see me for the first time. When she was lovelorn, we met her in our dormitory 
and her friendship dormitory. She said I was a nerd, but when she invited Xu and 
Han to the cafe, they really took a leave of absence for three days and looked 
at each other with new eyes. I deliberately said a lot of sad things. I told sy 
to find her. I was sad for a while. She said that I was a child because we 
didn&#39;t do what adults do. We just hugged her for a while.<br>
<br>
At 5:30, I sent her back. I agreed to accompany me on Saturday and Sunday, and I 
wouldn&#39;t go to the movies with other boys.<br>
<br>
Take her to the No. 13 bus station, but she didn&#39;t make out on the way. When I 
got to the bus station, I said I wanted to shake hands, and she walked away with 
a smile. When the car came, she stretched out her hand to say goodbye. I said 
no, put my hand in my pocket. She smiled and left.<br>
<br>
But where is my Han Qinfen!<br>
<br>

<br>
Today, I slept all day. I slept in the southwest building. The old man came to 
class and ate twos of chaos. Then I slept in the dormitory. After lunch, I slept 
in the &quot;foreign literature&quot; class until more than 4 o&#39;clock.<br>
<br>
Later, I cheated Alin and said that it was very interesting that I got involved 
with Wang Qin until 2 o&#39;clock at night. He also drank zhengrenxiang wine, a 
total of more than 22, and was ready to do business and sell Yangzi.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
one thousand and five<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to Fengping to sit down. Later, I went to find hanqinfen. She 
wasn&#39;t in the dormitory. I found her in the classroom and went to the dormitory 
together. Then I said I had something to tell her and wanted to help. She 
guessed, saying yes, I said no. after a long time of guessing, she still refused 
to say. When I said yes, I blushed, and I guessed that I was the same. She 
looked at me and was ecstatic. She knew I was looking for her and liked her. She 
said she didn&#39;t expect it and said something mysterious and mysterious. I asked 
her to give an answer. She said she was in a hurry. I said my first feeling was 
right. She said that she would still maintain the original Ge Hanxu triangle 
friend relationship. I said it was impossible, and I said forget it. I told her 
that I had been with Zhang Ziyi last night. She said that Xu and I were very 
good at the cinema, but I saw the handle. I said that I couldn&#39;t control it, 
complained about her giving up her seat, and said that the relationship was 
over. She said there was a reason, she had a reason, but I didn&#39;t let her say, 
so she left. She wanted to keep it, but I insisted on leaving, so I asked her to 
tell Xu what I said. She asked me what she said. I said it was broken, but Xu 
wasn&#39;t there, so I rode back to Nanjing University.<br>
<br>
Alas, hanqinfen, I really like you, and you have agreed that I will bring you to 
Nantah alone. After drinking, you gave me the cup and said, &quot;I have no 
stomatitis.&quot; What is your heart?<br>
<br>
Not long after I came back, I was restless and a little cold, so I put on my 
clothes and went to find Han again. Pushing the door, Han said that Xu had gone 
to find me, so I asked her to wait with me at the gate of the school of 
traditional Chinese medicine. I talked about waiting for Godot and the station, 
saying that Han and I were here waiting for Godot, which did not exist. It meant 
waiting for each other to have it. Xu also decided to wait for Godot at Nantah, 
but she would not wait.<br>
<br>
Han then stood in front of me. I sat in the car and said something mysterious, 
asking her to tell us why we can&#39;t have it. She said nothing. I asked her if she 
had a boyfriend? She first said yes, but then said that she was just a male 
friend, not a boyfriend, or just like me. She said I shouldn&#39;t have done this, 
and said I couldn&#39;t figure out my heart. Let&#39;s say I should think about the film 
association and work. Then I said something. She said I was a little crazy. I 
asked her to scold me, but she stopped. I asked her when to wait. She said I 
would let her go. I said I would not let her go until one, two, ten or twenty 
years. Later, I said I would scold her, saying that she fooled around in primary 
school, and that the middle school student had a child, which was very cute. She 
said it was not nice to be cute. I said it was a pity that she was bald, because 
she was born by a monk. She walked away. I went up and said that she used her 
looks to seduce a foreigner and recognize a Ugandan uncle. She stroked her hair 
in the situation. It was so refreshing. She was angry and stood behind me. She 
said that at 10:30, I said there were 10 minutes left. She said five minutes, 
and grabbed my watch and looked at it. I said we were acting, a tree, a wall, a 
car, two people. She said she wanted to go. I said it was not dramatic. Later, I 
said you should go, and she left. I deliberately didn&#39;t look at her. Later, I 
saw that she had gone far, so I rode to catch up with her. She was very angry. I 
said something was going to happen (Xu). She said she wouldn&#39;t go to see Xu. 
Then she went upstairs and closed the door. I knocked on the door and told the 
dormitory that she had gone to bed. Tomorrow, I said yes and left.<br>
<br>
When she came back, Xu waited for me at the parallel bars, so I saw her off and 
told her that I liked Han Qinfen from the beginning. She said she looked like an 
adult, but in fact she was a child. Han looked like a child, but in fact she was 
an adult, and Han was very likable. In this way, I sent her to climb the door 
and go upstairs. She stretched out her hand to see her again. I said no, so I 
broke up.<br>

In the evening, Dai Weiyang said that 240 video tickets had been obtained.<br>
<br>
Dai said he would go to see Li Bo in the South traditional Chinese medicine, so 
he took paper mahjong with him.<br>
<br>
Han and Xu both studied by themselves. I called Han out in the classroom, smiled 
bitterly, and invited her to play mahjong with Xu. She said that she would not 
go this time. It would be rude to accompany her next time. I said that Bai 
Xianyong&#39;s novels had been brought. Do you want to read them? She said to read 
them, and the guitar let me sell them. The Nanjing girl in her dormitory said 
she wanted a guitar. I think she may have said such angry words, but now she has 
changed. She said Xu was in there. I said I didn&#39;t need to find her. She let me 
go. I didn&#39;t want to. She said to maintain the original relationship. She said I 
had said it was impossible. After a while, she said she would go in, but I 
wouldn&#39;t say. She went in, and I went downstairs.<br>
<br>
I went to the friendship dormitory with my second son and played with 
zhanglixia, Xu Lingge, wuzhengying, zhuchengling and xuyufang for a long time.<br>
<br>

In the morning, I sold 200 video tickets, which was very good. At the beginning, 
yangjinsong helped me with the meeting. Later, Zhou Jing and Guodi asked a 
classmate of philosophy 87 to help me sell it.<br>
<br>
Wushe 202 Wuhua said that he could get a good video and contact him later.<br>
<br>
Selling tickets, I met xulihua, who had been absent for a long time. After 
standing for a long time, she was very good.<br>
<br>
At noon, I went to find Zhou Jing and asked her to inform the team members to 
come to pick up the tickets at noon tomorrow, and Guodi was asked to guard the 
door.<br>
<br>
After finding Liu Yuan, I will have tickets for him to see.<br>

<br>
Wrote a love letter to hanqinfen. Then she wrote back and said, &quot;forget it. 
There are many better stars around me that I should look for.&quot;. Then I found 
that she was not so satisfactory. Alas, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
When I went back, I suddenly thought of Guan Hong. She was the only one who 
really loved me. But I didn&#39;t know at that time. I wanted to go home to find her 
at night.<br>
<br>
The next day I thought I couldn&#39;t do stupid things any more, so I went to class.<br>
<br>
The film association is busy again: Lizhongbao, gaozhiqing, liuwannian, Wang 
Jianmin, etc.<br>
<br>
Another video, the auditorium.<br>

<br>
Bashe often goes to: Nakamura Youli, zhengrenxiang, tangchaoyang, Liu Linlan, Du 
Jing and Yan Ling. The American girl Lili in Yan Ling&#39;s dormitory is really 
beautiful and friendly. I was the first time to meet such a beautiful and 
enthusiastic girl. I gave her a NTU film card, which I got from Lizhongbao. 
There were only five in the whole school. I, Lili, and three to daiweiyang, 
linyueen, and luzhizhou. Lili showed me a lot of photos, all so beautiful, just 
like an actor.<br>

Another video, wild geese in the woods and the French Lieutenant&#39;s woman, was 
released. 730 copies were sold, but I took another one. I only said 622 copies 
were sold. Members and friends gave 67 copies in total. The rest was my service 
fee. The tickets were sold with tangchaoyang.<br>
<br>
I did a good job in the ticket sales of general Peng, but the time was not good. 
After that, I finally pushed more than 200 tickets. I was worried that I 
couldn&#39;t push the cinema. I had to try the machine, so I refunded my ticket.<br>
<br>
The free movie ticket of dawn let Jin Youyan go to see it. She is really a 
charming Hangzhou sister. She gives people the feeling just like her name, very 
quiet and beautiful. I&#39;ve been sitting nearby, and I smell good.<br>
<br>
Set up a home appliance maintenance department to help Jin Youyan and Huang Li 
repair the machine. Oriole is a cousin of the king&#39;s mausoleum. I heard her 
violin on New Year&#39;s day in the middle of the county. It&#39;s very good.<br>
<br>
I got 73 New Year cards from Lao Mei. On that day, xuhaiying and libolai 
happened to have a lecture &quot;director Shi Yongsen talks about film trends&quot; given 
by our film association, and they gave them five.<br>
<br>
Went to sell, gave 4 pieces to luzhizhou and sold 2 pieces to jinyouyan for 0.6 
yuan.<br>
<br>
Xu Min talked about color expansion, but the price charged by the book 
photography agency was too high.<br>
<br>
I went to see Uncle Huping twice, met him once, and talked for a long time.<br>
<br>
At noon one day, Zhou Jingshan and the canteen had a drink. One was the head of 
the second canteen, and the other was the teacher who sold chaos. At the 
weekend, I gave two photos to an ugly girl in the canteen and bought several 
ducks for one yuan.<br>
<br>
I went to find gaozhiqing, took luzhizhou with me once, and came back for 
coffee. Lu invited me to have a meal with two foreign girls (Denmark and West 
Germany). The Danish girl paid 23 yuan, and then drank coffee. I paid 7 yuan.<br>
<br>
Now gaozhiqing and Lizhongbao are easy to talk about. Gao not only helped me 
make copies, but also introduced director Wang of the Military Club Cinema. In 
the future, he can help them sell tickets and make some money.<br>
<br>
The film week is that the Youth League Committee doesn&#39;t issue a note because it 
wants to do it by itself and has a bad relationship with Lizhongbao. Zhang 
Xisheng, the Party committee, only agreed after asking for a note from the 
Communist Youth League Committee. The political world is really dark. There are 
too many joints, and one level weighs on another. It is really difficult for 
China to handle affairs.<br>
<br>
Yesterday afternoon, I went to gaozhiqing with Zhou Jing. Zhou is still very 
beautiful. She said that her mother is in Guangzhou and is engaged in foreign 
trade. Her father is an associate professor of history and engaged in scientific 
research. She and Huang Li are alumni of Nanshi middle school. Next week you 
will learn mahjong, go and bridge from me. Alas, another star is so beautiful. 
As Han Qinfen said, there are many better stars around me to look for. But who 
understands me? I want to make money, I want to develop myself, and I want to be 
natural and unrestrained.<br>
<br>
In the evening, Wang Qin came to see another night of Shanlu Suode at dawn. She 
slipped in through the side door and occupied the mandarin duck seat. After 
watching the meeting, she hugged and drank coffee. Her body was so smooth. She 
was a sexy village girl. She hugged and stroked on the overpass. Now I can&#39;t 
figure out what was going on at that time. It seems like a dream. She rode her 
back and hugged her while riding. We were the only two people left in the world. 
When I arrived at Dingshan Hotel, I hugged and stroked for a long time. I really 
didn&#39;t want to leave. I didn&#39;t break up until 12 o&#39;clock. I made an appointment 
to meet at the back gate of Nanjing University at 9 o&#39;clock tomorrow evening.<br>
<br>
What should I do? No one told me, because no one understands me, even I don&#39;t 
understand me. Let everything develop naturally. God will help me. Thank God.<br>
<br>
After moving to 350, I changed with Lao Jiang for 20 days. Now I have changed 
back. I have gone to live in the southwest 350 again.<br>
<br>
Zhou Jingshan said that the meeting would be held at 9 o&#39;clock tonight.<br>
<br>
I want to be great, I want to be a flesh and blood girl made of water, I have a 
career, I want to engage in film and television, I want to make money, I want 
Boston shoes, sweaters, down jackets, and I want to live a natural and 
unrestrained life.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Li Erqiao:<br>
<br>
Casual classmate:<br>
<br>
It&#39;s gone. In high school, Yimin old friend, my closest friend, we&#39;re going to 
break up, too. The past is hard to arrange the scenes, one by one, with 
thousands of thoughts and empty books.....<br>
<br>
The common love made us come together. In 83 years, we met in the sentence, 
ideal, sentiment, somehow, our thoughts are always synchronized.<br>
<br>
We used to talk together in bed, low and incisive. We didn&#39;t talk about 
anything, and we didn&#39;t tell each other about anything. One day we didn&#39;t meet, 
we felt that we had lost something in our hearts.<br>
<br>
We have walked in Jurong, the ancient city of Jurong, and we still have our 
shadow. On the campus under the moon, we discussed the future of life, discussed 
poetry, and smiled knowingly from time to time.<br>
<br>
How many times have I leaned against the fence and looked: serious, toad skill, 
lax discipline, one meter...... The common heart made us laugh happily.<br>
<br>
Can&#39;t bear to look back.<br>
<br>
Mr. Li is modest and polite, but he is humorous, and won our approval; The day 
will fall on such a person. His profound knowledge and profound literary 
accomplishment will give him a brilliant luster.<br>
<br>
Sorrow of separation, cut constantly, reason is still chaotic.<br>
<br>
When we can meet again, sing another song &quot;wine and coffee&quot;.<br>
<br>
Parting is a long time. Leave your schoolmates and return home with your youth.<br>
<br>
I wish you success!<br>

<br>
You are a very hardworking person. You keep improving in your study, have a 
sense of decency in dealing with the world, and have integrity, which I admire 
very much.<br>
<br>
As the sun approaches, I am compassionate. A man is ambitious. Where can he not 
show his talents and create great undertakings? But there is no need for such 
affection. But the sunset is the reason for our friendship. Even so, our mutual 
affection is unforgettable. May our friendship last forever.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s hard to part with each other when we leave, and I&#39;ll leave a message. May 
it be with you forever.<br>
<br>
The most obvious sign of a great man is his strong will. No matter how the 
environment changes, his original intention and hope will not change at all, but 
finally overcome the obstacles to achieve the desired goal.<br>

have read with you for two years. You are cheerful and straightforward, leaving 
me permanent memories. Our friendship has also been enhanced. You have given me 
help without forgetting. However, time is like an arrow, and we will soon be 
separated. Friendship is more valuable. May our friendship last forever.<br>

you and me. The intoxicating ribs and the maddening shark fin may make us 
unforgettable for life. It&#39;s a memorable four ah. We can&#39;t help talking about 
the common language, which makes us like a pair of lovers, At the time of 
parting, I wish you can find a lover who is tender and like-minded. Although the 
pain of parting cannot be expressed in words, I don&#39;t know when I will meet you 
in the future. I can&#39;t help crying (writing a poem) to say goodbye to you.<br>

Although we have only been schoolmates for two years, our friendship has also 
increased with the passing of the days. When I first came here, I remembered 
that you were wearing a yellow military uniform and looked very honest and 
flattering. But after spending some time together, I found that you were naive 
and lively.<br>
<br>
You, me and Erqiao are also the best friends. They often go to the streets or go 
to the movies together. I remember once when you quarreled with Erqiao, I was 
the middleman of the big media! But we also had a little farce, but because you 
were straightforward, generous and without any affectation, we were reconciled 
again.<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, remember? You and I drove to the 202 construction site at a high speed, 
talking about all parts of the world, and I vowed to travel all over China! That 
time left me an unforgettable memory.<br>

Lao Ge, remember? How many times, after the power failure, we have walked slowly 
and made &quot;exploratory&quot; walks.<br>

Lao Ge, remember? How many times have we climbed onto the roof of the learning

Jurong City.<br>

Ah! Lao Ge, I can&#39;t recall. It&#39;s too much to recall. Similarly, you have also 
played an exemplary role in learning, leading the class to make an &quot;exploratory&quot; 
March to the university campus.<br>

<br>
Two years ago, when I came to the county, I knew that there was a &quot;perfect&quot; Ge 
Yimin. At that time, I was very unconvinced, but I secretly convinced him after 
examinations, competitions and conversations.<br>
<br>
Yimin: you have an encyclopedic knowledge and superhuman intelligence. With your 
intelligence, &quot;Nantah&quot; is not worth mentioning. To be honest, your future is 
boundless.<br>

Yimin: it&#39;s better to listen to your words than to read for ten years. Your 
speech is unreal and silent. It often makes people aftertaste deeply and can&#39;t 
be recalled.<br>

Dear friends, on this occasion of parting, I wish you the best of luck in your

Since I met you, I know you are a classmate with wide knowledge and strong 
memory, so I am willing to talk with you. Over the past two years, you have 
helped me selflessly, which has benefited me a lot. We have learned and lived 
together, and our friendship has deepened day by day. But time flies like an 
arrow and time flies like a fire. When we parted, Everest was used as a pen and 
Xijiang as ink, and our friendship could not be written. As my best friend, your 
friendship will always remain in my memory. One day, we will absorb Xijiang, 
carefully weigh the Beidou, and Vientiane as guests.<br>

From now on, I would like to spend February as a slave and share with you as a 
close friend. I hope you will forgive my mistakes in the past. I should thank 
you affectionately. With this song, I&#39;ll accompany you on your journey tomorrow. 
It&#39;s beautiful, and your future is welcomed with palms. Jinbang, hang up the

When I met you in the classroom of senior two in the county, I called me &quot;this 
guy&quot;. I was very upset. You left me good memories: studious, selfless, 
ambitious, intelligent and superior. Ever remember: we were left in the 
classroom. Remember the past: we had common footsteps when the theater ended. 
Your help to me will always be in my heart. I wish you a good name in the golden 
list of universities. However, I hope you can appreciate others&#39; dim sum. People 
are not plants and trees. Who can be merciless. Anyone who does not want to 
become a talent and famous can not despise others, even if he wins the title 
first. The ancients had the true feeling that &quot;righteous people don&#39;t eat the 
food of Ho&quot;. What&#39;s more, we young people in the new era? I hope you will forget 
your previous gratitude and resentment and make progress hand in hand!<br>

admirable. You are admirable for your hard work and excellent performance. You 
and I used to be strangers, but now we are friends. My classmate has been 
studying for two years. He has a deep friendship. I can&#39;t bear to leave today. 
However, I miss your outstanding talent and my future will be boundless. I wish

get in touch with you, talk with you and get some inspiration from you, but I 
didn&#39;t succeed again. This is not only because of my poor influence among my 
classmates, who are afraid to bring you unnecessary troubles, but also because 
of your coldness, so I don&#39;t have the courage. This will be a pity for our 
classmates. Since we can&#39;t talk today, I hope the goose can build a golden

and study spirit, which makes me out of touch. Your eloquence, beautiful and 
moving articles, and extensive knowledge make me willing to fall at your feet. 
I&#39;m very glad to meet you in my life. It&#39;s too late to meet such an intelligent

intelligence and ability, hard work and hard work. Since ancient times, there 
have been many departures. It seems that departures are a worry, but this is by 
no means what we young people in the 1980s should have. Our separation today is 
to better talk about personal contributions to the country and society when we 
meet again several years later.<br>

On the occasion of farewell, I wish you all the best and a bright future. In his

are an unforgettable person and I admire your outstanding achievements.<br>

Although you are a good man, you are limited to the same sex, but you are so 
indifferent to the opposite sex. It is really puzzling. I can&#39;t imagine that you 
are so feudal.<br>

Your grades rank first in the class, but your English is not very good. I wonder 
why you don&#39;t make more efforts in this area.<br>

express my deep gratitude to you. I feel very lucky to meet a knowledgeable 
friend like you. I feel deeply blessed in my previous life and in my present 
life.<br>

Dear friends, maybe you still remember the competition between you and me in 
senior two. In fact, this competition has not stopped yet. I made some wrong 
mistakes in the competition, but you were magnanimous. With your broad mind and 
profound knowledge, I won my trust in the competition, which made me feel that 
you are decent and pure. I admire you very much.<br>
<br>
Dear friend: we are about to separate, and all corners of the world will run to

were together. Here, I ask you to be quiet and forgive me for being wrong with 
you and me.<br>

The moon is full and waning, and people have joys and sorrows, which is

express the pure friendship between students.<br>

The sea is wide with fish leaping and the sky is high with birds flying. I 
learned from my previous message that you are good at writing poems and 
compositions. I hope you can make great achievements and become the second &quot;Mao

<br>
Since Pangu opened the world, the three emperors and five emperors have reached 
the present. God in the misty world doesn&#39;t know how many good things he has 
done to the world and how many misfortunes he has given to the world. Because of 
God&#39;s arrangement, I have the honor to sit with you for a year. In fact, my 
generation has virtue in previous lives and was born by destiny.<br>
<br>
You and I have an extraordinary friendship. When we are sitting together, we 
fight and make noise every day. In class, we whisper about the characteristics 
of each teacher. Sometimes we can&#39;t help being handsome and laugh loudly, which 
makes the teacher stare at us. We were so scared that we stretched out our 
tongues and pretended to be serious. As soon as the teacher turned his eyes, we 
began to argue again.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s rare for you to have a quick mind. You have excellent subjects. You know 
everything about astronomy, geography, yin and Yang calendars, and you have an 
excellent memory. When taking history exams, I&#39;m always too lazy to be afraid of 
reciting. Because you don&#39;t panic, you can get more than 90 points every time. 
This is really inseparable from your &quot;help&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have always been arrogant and arrogant. It can be said that few people can be 
looked up to by me. However, zhoupeiyuan and Newton don&#39;t think much of me, and 
you are one of the few people I can look up to. You are talented. In the near 
future, you will be able to stand tall in the world literary world and win glory 
for your country. Nobel&#39;s legacy will cost you 190000 dollars. At that time, I 
hope you will never forget your old friends.<br>

been separated long ago. I said from other people&#39;s comments that you had 
excellent grades, which told you that if I wrote it, it would be meaningless. I 
admire you with all my heart. Don&#39;t boast about how smart you are. I always 
think he is far from being smart, because you are the only smart person I know, 
so I give you an example to refute, He was speechless. I often call you an old 
&quot;ox hooligan&quot;. Only we can know the true meaning. You are an &quot;ox hooligan&quot;

Lao Yimin:<br>
<br>
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve always called you, and I still call you that.<br>
<br>
(Lao Yimin), I always write messages for others very quickly. However, when I 
got your message book, I stopped and changed it again and again. For this 
reason, I tore a piece of paper from you. I always think I have a lot to say, 
and a lot to say to you!<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, remember? On the first day of high school, your bed was on the upper 
floor opposite me. I remember it was a hot day. You came early and the bed was 
already paved. I was sweating with heat. I saw a fan on your bed and borrowed 
it. Because I was afraid that you could not understand Maoshan dialect, I 
specially spoke it in Mandarin, but you mistook the pronunciation of &quot;fan&quot; in 
Mandarin for &quot;Shang&quot; in Dazhuo dialect. As a result, you thought I was going to 
bed, so you moved into bed and asked me to come up.<br>
<br>
After that, I told you this story more than once. Moreover, every time I told 
you it, I would &quot;scold&quot; you again, laughing that you didn&#39;t understand Mandarin, 
you didn&#39;t argue, but just grinned. It was funny to think of it. When I wrote 
here, I also laughed loudly, causing the neighboring tables to look at me 
inexplicably.<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, remember? In the lukewarm weather, after self-study every night, I 
went back to the dormitory. I washed my feet in a hurry, climbed into your bed 
and started a 15 minute talk show every day. During the conversation, I asked 
you again and again whether you were tired or sleepy. You always said, &quot;what are 
you sleepy about?&quot; As a result, our 15 minute talk often extended for a long 
time. We also talked about a wide range of poems, foreign celebrities, the 
character of our classmates and some people who couldn&#39;t stand it. The funny 
thing is that we often dislike a stranger at the same time. Why? I can&#39;t tell. I 
can&#39;t stand it anyway.<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, your bed was against the window. When the moon is full, the moonlight 
shines in through the window and onto your bed. We lie next to each other head 
to head, talking about the most precious things in our hearts. We often talk 
about the snoring of the people in the same dormitory.<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, (I was very interested in everything about you at that time), I asked 
you to repeat your grandfather&#39;s story again and again, and you also told me 
your grandfather&#39;s story with interest again and again. When you were very 
young, your grandfather asked you to recite poems. When you told me that you sat 
on the grandfather&#39;s lap and begged him to tell another story, my heart became 
excited. I seemed to go back to childhood with you. At this time, I saw your 
eyes looking at the moon with emotion, immersed in the memories of the past. Lao 
Yimin, some people say you are ruthless. I want to say that he doesn&#39;t know you. 
In fact, your feelings are very abundant and your performance is very different. 
Maybe I am the only one who knows!<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, I once said to you, &quot;in my seventeen years of existence (Senior One), 
you also exist.&quot; You smiled and said, &quot;of course,&quot; but I said, &quot;if one of us 
fails to pass the examination in the county, we won&#39;t know each other.&quot; You 
smiled and said, &quot;it&#39;s such a coincidence.&quot; I finally had nothing to say.<br>
<br>
Old Yimin, I have laughed at your deep eye socket more than once, just like the 
portrait of Darwin posted in the class. I often ask you to drum up your arm 
muscles and let me pinch them. You always promised. Maybe that&#39;s what they call 
your girlish character.<br>
<br>
So, my selfishness was satisfied. I found that no one really knew you except me, 
at least so far.<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, do you still remember such a move? Grab it on your body, then put it 
in front of your nose and smell it. When I asked you what you smelled, you 
always said it was unconscious. In fact, you didn&#39;t smell it, but it was a pity 
not to smell it.<br>
<br>
Finally, at the end of the first semester of senior high school, we should 
divide our subjects. I asked you to study science with me more than once, but 
you persuaded me again and again that even if we were not in the same class, we 
would have many contacts. Indeed, we keep in touch with each other all the time.<br>
<br>
Now we are about to break up. When we break up, I don&#39;t have any flowery words 
for you, because I know that flowery words are pleasant to hear but useless. We 
still have a long way to go, and we won&#39;t and can&#39;t always be smooth sailing in 
the process of moving forward, and we will encounter difficulties from time to 
time. As for being a writer and a great man, it is still a matter of struggle, 
Yimin! Do you understand me?<br>
<br>
Lao Yimin, please grant me a small request. When you publish your first article, 
write to me and let me be happy for you.<br>

We were thousands of miles apart, all for the sake of knowledge. We came 
together, but in order to realize our respective ideals and pursuits, we have to 
separate. When we get together, we are incomparably happy and happy, but the 
difference is such pain. At this parting moment, I look back on the past and 
leave many beautiful memories.<br>
<br>
We were classmates in the first year of high school. At first we didn&#39;t know 
each other. All I know is that you worked hard and went to the classroom to read 
after dinner. After the mid-term exam, your grades ranked among the top spears, 
which made me know you. In frequent contacts, we have gradually become familiar 
with each other and become good friends. I know more about you. You are 
extremely smart and intelligent. You know everything in Encyclopedia, and you 
like to talk about the world. At this time, your advantages will be reflected.<br>
<br>
You treat people kindly, laugh at them, and make good friends. As we leave 
today, please take my friend&#39;s wishes: I wish you a bright future and happiness.<br>

When I mentioned Yimin, I really admired him. Although you were a schoolmate 
with me for only one year, we were enlightening friends and deeply rooted.<br>
<br>
You are calm and lively, but you are afraid of female classmates. It seems that 
a mouse sees a cat. You have studied hard, kept improving and achieved very good 
results. Although we didn&#39;t talk about it, your luck has been occupied in my 
heart. In a short year, you made friends with your heart, and your help to me 
will never be forgotten. Alas! Hateful, heaven has no eyes, so we must part, but 
I only wish that when you step into the high mansion, don&#39;t look at your 
classmates and good friends. Wish: Jinbang high school has a bright future.<br>

To farewell friend Ge Yimin:<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, do you remember? At the beginning of high school, I sat with Tan 
Derong, you sat with zhangdaoping, and we just sat in front of you. A few days 
after the start of school, you and I didn&#39;t even know each other&#39;s names, so we 
began to talk. Do you remember? One evening, in the self-study class, I, you and 
Wang Feng sat in the back row talking about English. In junior high school 
English volumes 1 to 6, we actually looked for words that were difficult to 
remember and memorize in the word list behind the book and asked each other 
questions. Each time, I won. Do you remember what you said? You said, &quot;how can 
you remember so clearly, you little fellow?&quot; In fact, this is not surprising, 
because I spent the whole summer vacation on memorizing words. Otherwise, how 
could I remember so clearly?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, do you have any improvement in your pen writing? Should we make 
progress? I want to laugh at the thought of your writing. When you write, you 
always hold the pen tightly, as if it would fly away in case you don&#39;t hold it 
tightly. Then the Dragon flies and the Phoenix dances, and writes at will. The 
nib jumps on the paper, which is really funny. And your English handwriting is 
also very poor. Do you still remember when Mr. wangyinquan asked you to go to 
the blackboard to translate sentences in high school? I remember it very 
clearly, and I still haven&#39;t forgotten that when you finished translating the 
sentences and walked off the platform, the students couldn&#39;t help laughing at 
your words. You were so embarrassed that you blushed and grabbed your hair. Yes, 
your handwriting is so bad that it doesn&#39;t seem to be written by a high school 
student. No wonder the students laugh at you! I wonder if you have made any 
progress now? I&#39;d like to remind you that when you take the college entrance 
examination, you have to deduct points if you scribble!<br>
<br>
In my freshman year of high school, I did very well in history every time. You 
praised me for my good memory. I should study liberal arts with you, but I 
studied science. I remember you felt sorry for me at that time. In fact, I don&#39;t 
want to be separated from you! I think, if I really read liberal arts, I must 
sit in front of you with Tan Derong and discuss problems with you to improve 
together.<br>
<br>
Now, two students in senior one, two in liberal arts, two in science, and one in 
each. You and my colleague Derong read liberal arts, and I and your fellow 
zhangdaoping read science. What a coincidence!<br>
<br>
It&#39;s said that you have been ranked among the top spears in your liberal arts. 
I&#39;m happy for you. I congratulate you on your greater achievements in the 
future!<br>
<br>
Before you leave, I want to remind you of two things:<br>
<br>
First, you should find some calligraphy books in the future, copy them carefully 
and write them well.<br>
<br>
Second, you should spend more time on foreign languages to improve your foreign 
language performance.<br>
<br>
I think there will be a farewell day for you and me this time. Let me leave some 
words to talk about later.<br>
<br>
Goodbye, Ge Yimin!<br>

Farewell to my friend Lao Ge:<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, do you remember that in the first year of senior high school, we slept 
in the same upper and lower bunks, but we seldom talked. I don&#39;t know why. Maybe 
it was just that we had just entered the county. We both thought there was a 
sense of strangeness. We both felt mysterious about each other. However, through 
a year of reading together with our classmates and two years of observation, we 
learned that you are as one as you are outside and inside, and are not sociable. 
But your profound knowledge, like a sea full of water, is never revealed at 
ordinary times. Although your grades are very good, you are very modest towards 
every student, which really makes me admire. Only when you take the exam, just 
like when the tide occurs in the sea, can your knowledge and talent be revealed, 
surging, magnificent and beautiful, and your ability will make me admire.<br>
<br>
I would like to point out that you are not sociable, and your personality can 
change gradually. You are a liberal arts student, and you must have a strong 
ability in this aspect. Although you smile when you meet people, you rarely talk 
like you are shy. In particular, you are overwhelmed and shy when you meet the 
opposite sex. This is very bad. A person has to deal with other people, As a 
science student, I must remind you to pay attention to cultivating your social 
skills.<br>
<br>
Your talent is amazing. Your knowledge is rich and your brain is the repository 
of knowledge. You will certainly be able to enter a key university. At the time 
of this separation, although you are not the same subject or classmate, you and 
I are not ordinary friends. The flowers of our friendship are opening up. Let 
me, as an old friend, wish you:<br>
<br>
Take care of yourself all the way to the top of the list,<br>
<br>
Make progress and live a happy life!<br>
<br>
I wish I could go to the Chinese Department of Nanjing University to find you!!<br>
<br>
Please don&#39;t forget your old friends!!!<br>
<br>
Your friend: Chengming<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You Xuezhong:<br>
<br>
To Lao Ge:<br>
<br>
When I opened my mouth, people might think I was calling you &quot;old dog&quot;. However, 
I called you Lao Ge. People have to ask why I called you &quot;old&quot; Ge when I was 
young. Ha, he doesn&#39;t know the word &quot;old&quot;. It can be said that &quot;all realms come 
out&quot;. It truly reflects our friendship. Some people call you &quot;Lao Yimin&quot;, which 
means the same.<br>
<br>
I sincerely convinced you, Lao Ge, that you really have a way of learning. I 
remember we often talked about this when we discussed after the division. Some 
people thought that you didn&#39;t work hard, but you could get good grades. They 
made a mistake. I think that your characteristic is high efficiency. You read 
books for half an hour, which is equivalent to others&#39; reading for an hour. In 
this way, you look a little easier, but in fact, I think your half an hour&#39;s 
hard work is better than others&#39; one hour, right?<br>
<br>
Well, your study is well known. There is no need to say anything. I would like 
to say something about your life. You are very enthusiastic, funny and 
knowledgeable, but your performance in dealing with girls can not satisfy me. I 
sincerely advise you that liberal arts students rely on one mouth and one pen to 
win the world. You should not be afraid to look up when a reporter interviews 
female compatriots in the future. (actually, I am the same, but I don&#39;t mind.).<br>
<br>
Finally, I wish that you can enter the University in your heart without 
guarantee.<br>

Farewell gift to ge Yimin:<br>
<br>
Although I have been with you for half a year, it is difficult to express my 
friendship for half a year. When I was about to leave, I suddenly felt sad. It 
was difficult to leave, and it was even harder to meet. I didn&#39;t know when and 
when I would meet again. Goodbye to your smile, and then I heard your voice. I 
had to sing &quot;wine and coffee&quot; to the sky in the air. However, the coffee didn&#39;t 
taste. You will go, think long, and sing a song:<br>
<br>
Send off your comrades in arms, set foot on the journey, silently shed two 
tears, and your voice sounded in your ears<br>
<br>
No restraint to read, chat to send you a word, wish you a long song<br>
<br>
Step on the sand Give to the people<br>
<br>
Fragrant campus, learning in the same boat,<br>
<br>
Green fields, dining and sleeping together,<br>
<br>
But in the spring, he complained about his departure. It is an infinite number.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s time to say nothing: it&#39;s said that don&#39;t quit after farewell:<br>
<br>
Half a year of classmate love difficulty. The long-term friendship remains the 
same.<br>

I have been a classmate for less than a year, but your image in my mind will 
never be erased. You are a non talkative classmate with top grades. According to 
your intuition, you are a man with lofty aspirations.<br>
<br>
We have never talked before. Before leaving, I would like to borrow a page of 
paper to show my heart. I wish you:<br>
<br>
You have a bright future, and you will achieve success in your studies!<br>
<br>
Victory beckons to you, and the dawn is ahead!<br>

Ge Yimin:<br>
<br>
We met last spring. But don&#39;t you want to ask me that---- &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Why didn&#39;t I ask you---- &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, we know each other. We know each other in the spring of nature; It is 
enough to know each other in the spring of our lives. Why ask: &quot;who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel that you and I are both a drop of water, each from a different 
place. A rainstorm - the cradle of the great soul, makes you and I become a drop 
of water. In the air, in the sound of thunder and lightning, in the control of 
the wind, after a painful journey, I have temporarily found a place to live, the 
green holly tree.<br>
<br>
You and I fall on the same tree, but each has its own land under its own feet. 
Is the leaf you live in a boat? Green side, green mast. I don&#39;t know. What kind 
of oar did you paddle and what kind of sail did you pull?<br>
<br>
In the thick spring, the smile, like a wisp of smoke, dissipates, dissipates, in 
the bright morning, in the quiet night.<br>
<br>
When a bead of water with the desire to purify itself, with the longing for the 
boundless sky, accumulates strength and is ready to change and fly, another bead 
of water, please let her say &quot;take care of you&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you hear my wishes, doubt is the whisper of the breeze;<br>
<br>
If you hear my wishes, doubt is the trembling of leaves.<br>
<br>
You don&#39;t have to ask, &quot;who are you? I took your wishes, but who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The door of spring is open for you, and the door of the world is open for you. 
Go in with your talent, confidence and courage.<br>
<br>
And I, I can only watch you go forward, behind you, silently watching.<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t ask, &quot;who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
In the future, you won&#39;t lose sight of the sun. When the clouds come for a 
while, you don&#39;t have to look for me. At that time, bless you, comfort you, 
there will be other people, because you do not know who I am.<br>
<br>
If you must know, please ask the breeze, the moon and the ocean. In the game of 
light wind, in the clear brightness of the moon, and in the movement of the 
ocean, you will find a silent but satisfactory answer:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a drop of water.&quot;<br>

<br>
You and I are like two stars in the universe,<br>
<br>
Running along their respective tracks,<br>
<br>
We met head-on several times,<br>
<br>
And I said goodbye several times without saying a word.<br>
<br>
It is not easy to know but difficult to deal with,<br>
<br>
But a hazy veil of mist,<br>
<br>
So that we can not understand each other.<br>
<br>
The melancholy of parting makes people depressed,<br>
<br>
It evokes thousands of melancholy,<br>
<br>
Make my heart turn low.<br>
<br>
Goodbye, friend,<br>
<br>
Maybe on the way of life<br>
<br>
Without the focus of our farewell,<br>
<br>
Only in the pages of memory,<br>

Leave these short lines of Acacia.<br>

These are often the topics talked about by the villagers. I envy you and admire 
you. I am proud to have you as a talented fellow. You are a new star and will 
appear in the sky over your hometown. At that time, I congratulate you.<br>

Only half of my classmates have been silent for half a year, and there are few 
left. But I still admire you very much, your attitude to life and your smart 
thinking. With few men&#39;s &quot;clean&quot; temperament. Sometimes I wanted to end our 
test, but my courage failed in front of the facts, so that today. At this time 
of parting, what can I say to a friend like me, a real person who is the most 
unknown but most admired?<br>
<br>
I think it&#39;s better not to say that God will give everyone the most appropriate 
arrangements. You are now the pride of Jurong liberal arts class and will be the 
pride of China in the future. There is no doubt that you do not need any wishes. 
Thank you for leaving me a message today. I am very moved and feel guilty. I 
hope you can forgive all our unhappiness. Only after the bitter cold can the 
plum blossom blossom blossom. Friendship may be the same philosophy.<br>
<br>
Say something rash, I always regard you as a model in my heart, and my service 
is measured by you. In the real world without art, you may be the most admired 
person I have ever seen. I admire your profound knowledge, eloquent eloquence, 
amazing memory and your own way of life.<br>
<br>
People are different, otherwise there would be no world, but why can&#39;t the 
superior and the inferior shorten the distance. My only answer is that they all 
love themselves. Self love makes me rise and immerse me. The meeting with you 
made me feel the true meaning of life.<br>
<br>
Your talent is about to shine. I envy you. I deeply realize that knowledge makes 
people great. Here I silently bless you, wishing you a victory to bid farewell 
to our separation; Say goodbye to all our May you send me a long letter after 
you leave. Reading your composition will make me feel better. Reading your 
Chinese letter must be refreshing. May we meet again at Mochou Lake.<br>

<br>
Once upon a time, we became sincere friends. I think at that time, we were 
really eating and drinking together. We sat together in the evening for 
self-study and learned &quot;martial arts&quot;. What we heard and saw were true 
friendships. Looking back on those, we thought of leaving today, and our hearts 
were tense<br>
<br>
Zeng geometry, we strolled in Jurong City, hand in hand, side by side, talking 
and laughing as we walked, which attracted the envy of passersby.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know why, you became the leader of our 209 stick sect. But when did it 
cause &quot;mass anger&quot;, you were dismissed from office, so you had to control your 
&quot;strict master&quot;. Finally, Laoda became your loyal &quot;lackey&quot;. How can it not be 
exciting to recall this?<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, when did we invent &quot;concept&quot;, &quot;balagra Ma Zi&quot;, &quot;ASU&quot; (not my invention) 
In the future, when we recall the good life at this time, we will have the pain 
of &quot;hate steel made of iron, can&#39;t return to iron&quot;!<br>
<br>
Another time, we both drilled into the library to swim the ocean of knowledge.<br>
<br>
At another time, we shared the interesting and moving plot of the eight heavenly 
dragons. At that time, I entered the story only after you.<br>
<br>
Another time, we picked the charming &quot;wild flowers&quot;, which let us divide up all 
the charming flowers. We are happy to tell the truth when you meet people (ER 
Qiao)!<br>
<br>
At another time, we became inseparable chess friends. From just turning on the 
light to turning off the light, we continued to light candles, until the sky was 
dark and the stars were bright. Finally, we went to the dormitory and ended 
after being disturbed and resentful by the student union. Can&#39;t I get excited 
when I think of this?<br>
<br>
When I got up early in the morning, you asked me to wake you up, recite English 
words together, and talk while walking. I really had some fun. After writing 
here, I went back to that time again and again.<br>
<br>
At another time, we went from house to house looking for TV. In front of the TV, 
we smiled at each other at the same time.<br>
<br>
When! You asked me to sing the theme song of blood suspicion again and again. If 
Lao Ge would like to listen, I would like to sing it for you ten times.<br>
<br>
At another time, you and old Beiyu got tangled up, and were pushed by members of 
209. You laughed until your belly ached.<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, your temper is also very strange. Sometimes, like the weather in July, 
you will change as you say. However, it will be strange for a short time. The 
ice melts and the snow melts, and you are reconciled as before.<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, your grades are very good. This is the only thing brother Bi regrets. 
You and I have studied fascinating geography problems together. I am really very 
satisfied. Lao Ge, it&#39;s obvious that you go to university. However, I, Lao Diao, 
would never want my sincere friend to be admitted to a non key university. I 
hope you can be admitted to a key university.<br>
<br>
In addition, I wish you find a partner who is as beautiful as flowers and moon. 
Don&#39;t forget to invite me to eat happy candy at that time!<br>

Hello, the high school study life is coming to an end, and the time for you and 
me to separate is coming. At this time of separation, as a four-year old 
classmate, I feel very sad and full of dependence. What&#39;s more, we used to learn 
at the same table and sleep together.<br>
<br>
It is said that there is a bridge between the soul and the soul. Some of them 
are very long, some are very short. They can&#39;t cross with a short foot, and they 
can&#39;t get through by train for a long time.<br>
<br>
Lao Ge, do you remember that you and I, as the so-called &quot;top students&quot; of the 
school, were selected to the class of teacher sun of Dazhuo middle school, grade 
three (1), and we met like this. We met in this small world and met many new 
words. Among these friends, you are not very verbal, but you are not depressed.<br>
<br>
At first, you didn&#39;t impress me very much. However, we later sat on a bench. 
With the passage of time, we established feelings and had a certain 
understanding of each other. After a short year, junior high school was about to 
graduate, and our friendship was tested.<br>
<br>
After graduating from junior high school, we had a little painful stage. We 
always thought we would not come together. However, it is gratifying that we met 
again in a new environment. This may be a clever arrangement of God and a reward 
from fate.<br>
<br>
Lord! Lord of my God, I thank you with tears.<br>
<br>
Pure heart, the feelings between them are sincere and flawless. It can stand the 
test.<br>
<br>
When we first came to the county middle school, we were in grade one of senior 
high school. Because we have a certain &quot;foundation&quot;, although we are not in the 
same class, our friendship has developed to a certain extent. From the original 
classmates to close friends.<br>
<br>
In my freshman year of high school, I didn&#39;t live on campus. In order to make it 
easier for them to see each other, I served dinner on behalf of them at school. 
Then I lent my rice bowl to you and you kept it properly for me. Your dormitory 
has become my borrowing place. Sometimes when it is too late for self-study at 
night, I will sleep with you for a few nights, and lift the pillow<br>
<br>
A gust of true breeze urged us to enter a dreamy place. Since then, we have 
become inseparable. As a friend, I have also done a few feats for you that I am 
proud of.<br>
<br>
For example, during the holidays, the school is not responsible for keeping some 
items that students can&#39;t take back in their dormitories, and requires students 
to properly solve them themselves. If you have no relatives or acquaintances in 
Jurong, your suitcase will become a problem. When you find me, I promise and 
solve it satisfactorily<br>
<br>
Finally, I asked my senior one classmate chenzhongyu to take him to his uncle&#39;s 
house. You were very satisfied with this and thanked me. However, as a friend, 
what is this small matter?<br>
<br>
This is how we get along. We help each other and live in harmony. However, I 
can&#39;t stop writing here. I think of the moments when we lived together in grade 
two of senior high school. At this time, the relationship between us reached a 
peak.<br>
<br>
After the end of the academic year of senior 11, due to their different 
interests and hobbies, I entered the science class and you entered the liberal 
arts class. I was assigned from the original class (1) (i.e. class 1 of senior 
1) to class (2) (i.e. class 2 of Senior 2), and you were assigned from the 
original class (2) (i.e. class 1 of senior 1（<br>
<br>
2) Class) was assigned to class (1) (that is, class (1) of senior two). This may 
be a little joke played by the LORD God. However, such a small twists and turns 
has not damaged our friendship in the slightest, but has further promoted our 
friendship. It can be seen that our<br>
<br>
Friendship is a flower that never withers and has indomitable vitality.<br>
<br>
By chance, we both lived in the same dormitory, a mixed dormitory of class (1) 
and class (2). In this way, we entered a new life. During this period, we 
reached the situation of using the same basin and the same bottle of water. As a 
liberal arts student, you need<br>
<br>
After reading some literature books, I borrowed some famous books for you, such 
as Don Quixote, Gulliver&#39;s travels and selected poems of the laws of the Tang 
and Song dynasties. We studied them together and learned from each other until 
late at night.<br>
<br>
In winter, we thought it was a little cold to sleep in one bed, so we decided to 
share the same bed and warm each other. When the clothes couldn&#39;t be replaced, 
we changed clothes with each other. Although it was a few times, we had seen a 
spot. That&#39;s how we treat each other<br>
<br>
Caring and helping each other, our &quot;little husband and wife&quot; life is so happy.<br>
<br>
In my memory, there are many things worth remembering in the second year of 
senior high school, which are full of poetic and picturesque interest.<br>
<br>
I remember that in order to have enough energy to study and arrange the time 
reasonably, when winter came, you and I made a treaty to practice long-distance 
running in the morning. The first day, we both got up very early with great 
interest. Although it was cold outside, we all wore sportswear and sweatpants 
because our<br>
<br>
My heart is burning, so we run around the city. Because you usually exercise 
less, you have been running behind me, but you have a tenacious perseverance, 
and firmly ran down. On the second and third days, my interest was not very 
strong. Because of the excessive amount of exercise on the first day, I<br>
<br>
Their calf muscles are a little allergic, and their legs ache all day long. On 
the fourth day, we were finally defeated by sleepiness and laziness. We didn&#39;t 
think of it when we were lying in bed in the morning.<br>
<br>
I also remember that after lunch one day, I rode my bike to visit the newly 
built Christian Church to see what kind of place it is. After all, it has a 
sense of mystery for us two young people with communist ideology. We are full of<br>
<br>
The feeling of hope was on the way. However, we were disappointed when we 
arrived there. There was only a newly painted Church House with a door facing 
south. Outside the door was a courtyard the size of a house. There was a blood 
red cross on the Western gable, which was the size of a man<br>
<br>
Small, next to the cross below is the word Christian Church. In our opinion, 
this Christian Church must be a magnificent courthouse or synagogue like church 
hall, but it is inhabited by a so-called Christian family.<br>
<br>
See here, give us the conclusion is to leave here. At this time, we thought of 
zhaowangshan, which is the place to visit the Tomb every year. There is a martyr 
cemetery there. It is said that it is being built there. We are on our way again 
with the mood of walking around and continuing. I&#39;ll train you as I walk<br>
<br>
, you should think how responsible I am. When we arrived at zhaowangshan, we 
walked around the site for a week. With a feeling of respect, we were full of 
memories of the martyrs, and watched an antique Memorial being built. Then we 
prepared to go down the mountain. Before going down the mountain, we made a 
division of labor<br>
<br>
When I ride my bike, you pull a hand behind me to prevent it from tumbling. We 
just tumble down the hill.<br>
<br>
I also remember that after lunch one day, we rode our special car and embarked 
on a new journey. This time, we went to the crematorium. In this small tour, we 
both told a big lie, especially your acting skills, which made me admire. 
Beginning<br>
<br>
When we touched the road, we only remembered one direction. We didn&#39;t know the 
direction of its gate. We only knew that it was heading towards the location of 
the chimney. When we got there, we saw that it was an ordinary courtyard. We 
went in through a side door and saw a lot of weeping elephants inside. There is 
flow<br>
<br>
The families of the dead with tears of filial piety, including the 
expressionless master stove and the huge chimney with huge body and smoke 
silently. Just as we were feeling strange and looking around, a ghost like man 
flashed over from nowhere and asked coldly with a dead face:“<br>
<br>
For what? &quot; We answered, &quot;we&#39;re looking for someone.&quot; With a look of fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you looking for?&quot;<br>
<br>
You then replied, &quot;for my uncle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What&#39;s your last name?&quot;<br>
<br>
You hesitated and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. But I know him.&quot; &quot;Oh, I think it&#39;s 
Zhang?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don&#39;t know the surname of Zhang. We have a Wang here who is sleeping or 
having a meeting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He asked me to come to him at 12:30 this afternoon. You see, it&#39;s just after 
12:30.&quot; You raised your wrist and looked at your watch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then go find it yourself.&quot; The man said a word and turned away.<br>
<br>
Relieved, we quickly picked up our car, rushed onto the highway, and moved back 
to the city. Behind us, the big chimney was still emitting small smoke.<br>
<br>
All these wonderful memories are now full of aftertaste.<br>
<br>
After graduating from senior two, our study and life became much more tense. In 
the year of senior three, our friendship has a long history and will never dry 
up. We often help each other weigh the rice and have fun in it. We had a heart 
to heart talk with each other<br>
<br>
Pour out the things in your heart. Try our best to help and be considerate, so 
that our hearts and minds are connected.<br>
<br>
In the third year of senior high school, we also spent several nights together, 
talking about our ideals and sharing our hearts. I remember some time ago, when 
you were preparing to take part in the national competition, you needed someone 
else to copy it for you. When you found me, I promised, and spent a few hours 
copying it for you, although due to some original<br>
<br>
Because I didn&#39;t use what I copied, but as a friend, it&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s a 
friend&#39;s affection.<br>
<br>
Now I am about to graduate. As a friend, I can only recall the heavy memory, 
think of the happiness at that time, and think of your personality. You are 
cheerful, optimistic and full of delusions. You are quiet and enthusiastic. You 
are gentle and lovely, and you have a certain fortitude. You have a<br>
<br>
A smart mind, you have a pair of agile hands, you have a casual demeanor. You 
are free and easy in the world. As a beloved of God, you stand proudly between 
heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
As an old friend, I can see that you have a bright future. After graduation, you 
are about to leave. With the wishes of concentric people, you are proud to move 
forward. Farewell, Yimin Jun.<br>
<br>
Parting does not mean farewell. Please don&#39;t cry and don&#39;t be sad. The days 
ahead are still long. I believe we still have a time to meet. Then we will talk 
to each other again and continue our precious friendship to carry forward.<br>
<br>
As an old friend, good classmate and concentric person, I give you a heartfelt 
wish: I wish you the best, best and best university!!!<br>
<br>
Wish you success in your studies, be proud of yourself and honor your 
ancestors!!!!<br>
<br>
I wish you a bright future and a quick start!!!!!<br>
<br>
I wish you a happy marriage!!!!!<br>
<br>
Wish our friendship,<br>
<br>
Like the pine that never grows old in Nanshan,<br>
<br>
Forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
May we make progress together on the vast ocean of knowledge and march forward 
bravely.<br>

The impermanence of life may lead to a change for the better or vice versa. In 
the picture, I was wandering and lonely in the early spring of this year. I 
believe there are still sunshine and flowers on the road ahead. I remember the 
first time I saw you was outside our 109 window. You and Shan Xiaopeng were 
standing outside the window. Unexpectedly, I will have a short fate with you. 
Today, on the last day of June, you will leave NTU and go to your own choice of 
freedom and style. Everyone has his own way and way. And everything in this 
world only gives me the feeling of fleeting years and water and the worry about 
life and destiny. Today or the last time you and I meet, maybe you are not you, 
and I am no longer who I am now. Now, I would like to leave my best wishes to 
you.<br>

If you are wanted, you must go to the busiest place. It is said that there are 
many girls there.<br>

Do not refuse friends, because there is a deep courtyard in your heart<br>

Not afraid of wind and snow, because there are fragrant grass in my heart.<br>
<br>
When you really understand the word &quot;cherish&quot;, you will mature.<br>
<br>
Going beyond the limit is as bad as falling short.<br>
<br>
In the future, follow the call of &quot;heart&quot; and be your own good &quot;lover&quot;,<br>
<br>
But don&#39;t let others down.<br>
<br>
If I need help in the future, I will try my best. Although you find it most 
difficult to get along with him, as long as you come to the door,<br>
<br>
I&#39;d still like to invite you to dinner.<br>

<br>
My tears don&#39;t flow for girls, don&#39;t cry for love, and don&#39;t flow for people who 
betray me.<br>
<br>
If one day, you defeat me behind my back, then you will not be my friend. When 
we meet again,<br>

is that you can play magic.<br>

Your greatest feature is that you are very unique.<br>

<br>
1. Strangers in heaven -- in memory of Sanmao<br>
<br>
In the yuan of 1992, when Mei Xue competed with Fang Fang, Ge Yimin said to a 
stranger in heaven that he had no choice but to sacrifice him. He said: &quot;I think 
Sanmao has been in the world since he was born. So far, it has been forty-nine 
years. I recall that Sanmao&#39;s quality is not enough to describe gold and jade, 
its nature is not enough to describe ice and snow as clean, its God is not 
enough to describe stars and moon as essence, and its appearance is not enough 
to describe its color.&quot;.<br>
<br>
500 years ago, he took an Indian man in gray,<br>
<br>
One year ago, I came to the ward of Taipei wing general hospital,<br>
<br>
Sanmao told him that he was very tired,<br>
<br>
The man in grey spread his white wings,<br>
<br>
Sanmao finally put down her Sahara,<br>
<br>
Started another journey,<br>
<br>
Strangers in this paradise,<br>
<br>
And sat at the right hand of the Lord,<br>
<br>
She was surprised to find that,<br>
<br>
I have pursued the Sahara all my life,<br>
<br>
But appeared in the kingdom of heaven of the Lord.<br>
<br>
But Sanmao is still repeating people&#39;s last words,<br>
<br>
So another Sanmao was repeating another Sahara to the people,<br>
<br>
He must also be a stranger in heaven,<br>
<br>
Because the planet has no place.<br>

4. Why are older migrant workers unwilling to marry the daughter of the central 
leadership<br>
<br>
Due to engineering reasons, the author often contacts with migrant workers and 
finds a strange phenomenon. All older migrant workers prefer to be single rather 
than marry the daughter of the central leadership. The daughter of the central 
leadership has a high political status, a certain amount of property, and 
generally looks superior. I try to understand that all migrant workers laugh:

daughters to marry the master?<br>

The number 3 is the most important number in the Bible. Jesus rose from the dead 
three days later. The prophet Jonah was in the belly of a fish for three days 
and three nights. When Jesus was transfigured, Peter would build three tents 
(including Moses and Elijah). Jesus prayed three times in Gethsemane. Peter 
denied the Lord three times. Judas sold the Lord thirty dollars. Jesus &quot;I can 
tear down the temple of God and build it again in three days.&quot; Paul waited three

Nerve 21 51. What conclusion can you draw from Adam&#39;s obedience to Eve&#39;s eating 
forbidden fruit<br>
<br>
Answer: henpecked<br>
<br>
First: human sin (original sin) is hereditary.<br>
<br>
Second: the human fear of wife (the original fear of wife) is also genetic.<br>
<br>
If a human family wants to be truly happy, it must have a good relationship with 
God. This relationship should be self selected, not reluctantly maintained. 
(Deuteronomy 30:15-20; Joshua 24:15) the Lord wants people to obey him, but 
people must do so from the heart and love. (Deuteronomy 6:5) therefore, the LORD 
made a stipulation in the garden of Eden, giving the first person an opportunity 
to prove his loyalty. God told Adam, &quot;you can eat the fruit of all kinds of 
trees in the garden, but you can&#39;t eat the fruit of the tree of distinguishing 
good and evil. If you eat it, you will die.&quot; (Genesis 2:16) this tree symbolizes 
that the wise creator has the right to decide what is good and what is evil. The 
Lord gave Adam a suitable wife, so Adam told his wife Eve the command of God.<br>
<br>
Later, one day, a snake (the revelation of the Bible shows that the original 
Snake was called the devil and Satan, which deceived people all over the world 
-- Revelation 12:9). This spiritual creature deliberately made himself a devil 
(slanderer) and Satan (adversary). He was seduced by his own selfish desires in 
an attempt to enjoy the status of God, so he rebelled against the creator-- 
James 1:14.<br>
<br>
Satan, the devil, seduced Eve and said, &quot;you will not die if you eat the fruit 
of distinguishing good from evil. You will be able to distinguish good from evil 
like God.&quot;-- Genesis 3:4, 5) he seems to claim that God has left you some good 
things. You can eat the fruit of the tree and decide what is good and what is 
evil just like God.<br>
<br>
So Eve took the fruit and ate it, and gave it to Adam. Although Adam knew the 
consequences, he listened to his wife and ate the fruit. As a result, they lost 
their paradise, Adam toiled all his life, Eve increased the pain of pregnancy 
and childbirth, and the Lord punished the woman: &quot;you will love your husband, 
and your husband will rule over you.&quot; However, the gene of fear of wife 
inherited from human ancestors is as unshakable as the original sin. So far, 
&quot;henpecking&quot; can be found everywhere, which is unexpected for Jehovah.<br>

Volume 2 Ge Shenyi&#39;s anecdotes: rivers and lakes years(june1989 – July 1990)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter I<br>
In the summer vacation of 1989, I stayed in school. Because I sold movie tickets 
to the military club last semester, I lost hundreds of movie tickets on my bike. 
I went to the cinema to refund my tickets. During the screening, I took Dai Yong 
and Lao Jiang to the ticket office and found that some students had sold my 
tickets. I went to the cinema security office and detained those students. They 
said that they belonged to a certain department of Nanjing University. The 
original tickets were found by an old lady. Because there was a note on it that 
said the name of a teacher of Nanjing University, the old lady sent them to the 
school, and some teachers gave them to the students of two departments. Later, I 
found teachers in two departments and compensated me for some money, but I still 
lost a lot. I sold blood for several times, but I still had a lot to lose. Now I 
think I don&#39;t have to pay the full amount, because I didn&#39;t sell the tickets and 
had to return them. Because I lost the tickets, the school teachers gave them to 
the students, and there were many empty seats, but I was too duty bound. Later, 
I went home to confess and my brother paid for them.<br>
<br>
On the street, I saw an old man set up a stall that gave people a prize to touch 
buttons. I learned to walk and set up a stall. Of course, I didn&#39;t make any 
money. A middle-aged man won me several yuan. Fortunately, he said to take it 
from the people and use it for the people. Then he touched it and returned it to 
me if he lost.<br>
<br>
Some people play three cards (bright yellow), that is, two diamonds 8 and one 
plum blossom Q. let me guess which one the plum blossom q is. I pressed 10 yuan 
twice. Of course, I lost. I pressed again. The person next to me (his partner) 
said, &quot;where is your money?&quot; I said no, he said don&#39;t press if you don&#39;t have 
money, and blocked me with his body.<br>
<br>
When I set up the button stall, there was a 30-year-old man named xialiwen. He 
remembered to wear a black T-shirt and took a fancy to me. He asked me to follow 
him in the Jianghu and play chess (Lizi card). That was cheating gambling. At 
that time, he had an apprentice with bad legs. He was much older than me. Xia 
left him alone.<br>
<br>
Xia told me the principle of three cards, that is, the dexterity of the hand. He 
held two cards in his right hand. In fact, what he put down was the card above. 
Common sense thought it was the card below. I also practiced. Later, I often 
asked my classmates to guess cards, such as Dong Jingping.<br>
<br>
Xia is actually a magician. I am the 17th generation descendant of Cangzhou Fang 
magic, and I am the 18th generation descendant of Cangzhou Fang magic.<br>
<br>
At the beginning, we two played chess in the residual game. I acted as a chess 
player, that is, the boss of the residual game pretended to play with the guests 
(idea, also known as Kaizi, Kailao b). Xia was the one who actually played chess 
with the guests.<br>
<br>
Xia taught me a set of scripts. The chess was set up by the roadside. Xia 
pretended to watch the chess. If a Kaizi came to see it, Xia said, &quot;the red 
chess is sure to win.&quot; how can I walk a few times and deliberately leave a 
break? That is, according to him, if the black chess is killing, he will lose. 
When Kaizi saw it, he said, &quot;red chess can&#39;t win. Black chess goes like this.&quot; 
when Kaizi said this, Xia deliberately went to the side and spit. He didn&#39;t 
listen to Kaizi. Then he came back and said that red chess was the first general 
to sophistry.<br>
<br>
Kaizi disagreed and argued. Xia said, &quot;if I want to win you, you will give me 10 
yuan&quot;. Then I hurriedly said, &quot;there must be a back and forth way to talk. If he 
wants to win you, you will give him 10 yuan.&quot; Xia said, &quot;OK.&quot; then he said to 
Kaizi, &quot;we all put 10 yuan in the chess boss&#39;s hand. Whoever wins will take it.&quot; 
then he put 10 yuan in my hand. Kaizi thought he was going to win, and he put 10 
yuan in my hand.<br>
<br>
Then they played chess and took two steps. Xia did not take that step (the car 
ate the horse) as he said at that time, but shelled the horse (pretending to 
think about it). Kaizi would not go. The two sides in the residual game played 
against each other. Both of us knew the chess. Kaizi didn&#39;t understand it. After 
two more rounds, she lost. Then I gave Xia 20 yuan. Xia took it and went away. I 
put away the chess and went to the alley to meet him. Before Kaizi wakes up, he 
stands in the same place and remembers where he went wrong. He doesn&#39;t know that 
he was cheated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter II<br>
<br>
Jianghu is not about fighting and killing like Guo Jing. It is not about 
chopping axes, as my college classmate Hong Yan often said. Jianghu is the mouth 
of the river and the lake. What you can see and what you can say is the Jianghu. 
People in the Jianghu should observe what they say, lie and cheat, and make them 
believe it. Jianghu people earn money. Even if they cheat, they cheat.<br>
<br>
Eight sects in the Jianghu: &quot;gold, leather, color, hanging, evaluation, 
regiment, tune and willow&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jin&quot; is to see the face of geomantic fortune telling. At that time, I was a 
little surprised that Jin ranked first. After working, I heard that the gate of 
a district government was transformed according to the geomantic omen division. 
Only then did I know that Jin Dang ranked first and that people made a lot of 
money.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pi&quot; refers to those who sell fake medicine, wild medicine, herbal medicine and 
dog skin plaster, also known as &quot;Han&quot;.<br>
<br>
”&quot;Cai&quot; is a magic trick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hang&quot; is to practice martial arts to show off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Review&quot; is storytelling and rap, adding to the story countless times in the 
streets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tuan&quot;, a crosstalk talker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tune&quot;: those who cheat, steal and sell fake goods also refer to those who sell 
anti smoking drugs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Liu&quot;: a person who sings a ditty, especially one who sings a certain kind of 
music.<br>
<br>
Lizi card (a chess game to cheat gambling) belongs to the &quot;Cai&quot; sect. Its 
ancestor is zhaokuangyin, the emperor of the Song Dynasty.<br>
<br>
Xia once took me to visit a Nanjing oratorical actor, went to his home to 
communicate, and asked him if he had anything in his mouth during the 
performance. Xia put something in his mouth. Later, Xia said he shouldn&#39;t ask. I 
later doubted Xia&#39;s identity. How did he know the address of the eloquent 
actor&#39;s house.<br>
<br>
Once, a young man in a rural area lost more than ten yuan. Xia took the money 
and walked away. He cried to me about his poverty and said that I wanted to 
refund the money for seeing a doctor. But after thinking about it, he would cry. 
Later, I often regretted.<br>
<br>
There are often people who don&#39;t have enough money to press their watches. They 
can&#39;t get out of the scam. They are trapped by our scripts and the atmosphere we 
create. They think they can win money immediately.<br>
<br>
Once, the other four were losing. He stopped playing chess. He always thought 
that he didn&#39;t want to. He immediately lost. Xia asked him to play chess. He 
said, what&#39;s your hurry? He also realized that he couldn&#39;t go on. Seeing that 
there were only two of us, he grabbed Xia and kept saying, what&#39;s your hurry? I 
didn&#39;t see how much money I could earn. I persuaded him to return the money from 
both sides. When he received the money, he said to Xia, &quot;give your money to the 
chess boss&quot;, and to me, &quot;give you a face&quot;, and they left.<br>
<br>
Once a local young man lost 10 yuan. I was still there. Xia didn&#39;t come back 
from the alley. The young man brought several people to us. He took off my 
glasses and asked for a refund. Seeing that he was very fierce, I said to refund 
you and compensate you for another 10 yuan. But the money was in Xia, so I took 
him to the alley to find Xia, and gave him an extra 10 yuan. He said that he 
would settle things with him in the future. He meant to cover it, ha ha.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the above reasons. We have changed from &quot;horse&quot; 
(one person, two of us), to &quot;wind&quot; (Gang fraud). We have been with another 
Jianghu people. They are Gao Niu B, Xiao Xue, Lao Ren, Lao Yang, and sometimes 
others. The people are not fixed when we get together.<br>
<br>
We often play chess in Xinjiekou. When chatting, we said that the Qing Dynasty 
played chess in villages and towns, the Kuomintang played chess in counties, and 
the Communist Party played chess in Xinjiekou, Nanjing:)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter III<br>
<br>
When there are many people, there are two more divisions of labor. One is the 
Sentry (Lao Yang, the most useless person), which is to observe nearby. When you 
see the police coming, you shout &quot;to the ground&quot;, and everyone stops dispersing 
when they hear it. The rest of the people stick to the dot. The Dotter tells 
about his chess. The Dotter explains to Kaizi that black chess is killing. When 
the Dotter puts forward a bet with Kaizi, the Dotter encourages Kaizi. When 
playing chess, when Kaizi can&#39;t play, those who stick to the point will help to 
play, so as to finish early. At the end, if Kaizi wakes up and wants to resist, 
those who sing the red face and stick to the point will persuade Kaizi to forget 
it, while those who sing the white face and stick to the point will threaten 
Kaizi. Usually Kaizi also understands the situation and thinks that she is 
unlucky to leave. They said that there were several Kaizi and several others. 
The two sides were close to each other and fought in groups. I never met them.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m a shelf, usually managed by Xia or Xiao Xue. The dens are Lao Yang&#39;s. Lao 
Ren&#39;s wife and Lao Yang&#39;s wife are responsible for cooking. They cheated Qian 
(called rotten head in Jianghu dialect) to eat chicken, duck, meat and ribs 
every day. Lao Ren&#39;s wife is very beautiful. They are from Shanghai. Lao Yang&#39;s 
wife is not good-looking. They are local people in Nanjing. But it was the ugly 
old Yang&#39;s wife. Xia was at her home. When they were the only two, they tried to 
use a watch (to cheat on gambling) with her. She refused, saying that old Yang 
knew it was wonderful.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know what enemy Ren has. He tried to ask me to get him some potassium 
cyanide at school. Let alone that I can&#39;t get it, I can&#39;t give it to him. I 
still know the importance of this.<br>
<br>
Chinese people are all farmers. For thousands of years, they have had some 
conditions. If they don&#39;t do anything, they will become women, even if they have 
only a little extra money.<br>
<br>
Xia accosted a woman at the bus stop. She was very beautiful and plump. We took 
her to my dorm. In fact, it was the room where my fellow student qinyibin gave 
me the key. They were Z. afterwards, they went out and I went in. Several 
students in the opposite building shouted hooligans. There were no curtains in 
the student dorm. Xia gave her the watch and lighter she had cheated. We took 
her to the bus stop. She was so beautiful that when I was about to get on the 
bus, I couldn&#39;t help touching her arm.<br>
<br>
Once a lady and her girlfriend had a lot of money. A middle-aged man with bad 
legs played games and gambled with him for 100 yuan. His girlfriend was very 
happy. She might know some chess. She thought she was going to win and clapped 
her hands. After losing, Kaizi woke up and claimed to beat us in business. Well, 
she was a big business man.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, we collected money at the entrance of the alley. The manager said 
that I was a shelf and gave more points. In Lizi cards, the most dangerous 
division of labor is to put on airs, which is most likely to be caught by the 
police, because you are playing chess at first sight. In addition, they are 
playing chess because they are actually playing chess. Onlookers can also 
testify that those who post are relatively safe, and can be regarded as those 
who interrupt blindly. Those who watch are the safest, which means they do not 
participate.<br>
<br>
Once in Xinjiekou, when I was watching chess, the police came and shouted 
&quot;local&quot;. I didn&#39;t hear them. One person was arrested (called Mao in Jianghu 
dialect) and taken to the police station. I didn&#39;t admit it. I said that he was 
from Nanjing University and was watching chess. I also reported the name of my 
classmate Tan Derong, philosophy department, hometown Jurong, and address of a 
new Maoshan village. At that time, there was no Internet, so it was impossible 
to verify. I learned from them to report other people&#39;s names. When they were 
Mao, they all reported other people&#39;s names. Sometimes they reported to each 
other. Gao Niu B was Mao and reported to Li Si in his name. When Li Si was Mao, 
he reported to Gao Niu B in his name. Because I looked like a college student, 
and let me go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IV<br>
<br>
One night, Xia, Gao Niu B and I were talking in my dormitory. Gao thought Xia 
was very good. He decided to worship him as a teacher, so he knelt down to 
worship him. I knelt down to worship him. Xia became our master. Gao was about 
10 years older than me. He became my senior brother.<br>
<br>
Once Gao and I went to a family who was also a social mixer. The man said that I 
had not surrendered to the Communist Party. They called it the surrender 
Communist Party after talking to the police in the district. The man said, I was 
at Xinjiekou and asked, &quot;do you want to be fat?&quot; It&#39;s pimping.<br>
<br>
Pangxi, a Nanjing dialect, refers to a girl. Xiao Xue says it is a pidgin in 
French. They pimp. It&#39;s very simple. When they catch a man in the street, they 
ask, &quot;ah, fat West?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gao Niu B&#39;s parents gave him a house. When he didn&#39;t live, sometimes he gave the 
key to someone else. One night, he took me there. He knocked on the door but 
didn&#39;t respond. He didn&#39;t turn on the light. He decided that there was someone 
inside, so he climbed through the window along the pipe and opened the door for 
me. After I went in, there were a man and a woman on the bed in the room. The 
woman was a prostitute with neat hair and was very young and beautiful.<br>
<br>
Gao has a partner who does business with him. His surname is Yang. I think Yang 
went to the bathroom at Gao&#39;s house and squatted on the toilet. Because there 
are many people using it and prostitutes using it, I&#39;m afraid there is a virus. 
Yang told me that these people are the so-called scum of society. Yang has a 
girlfriend who is beautiful but looks vulgar.<br>
<br>
I remember when I came back to school at the Gao family, I often hummed a song 
(my beloved town) &quot;when I first came here, I was so strange. It rained on a cold 
winter night, and I didn&#39;t have any friends. I was so excited when I met you 
that day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gao later changed rooms with others and built a bungalow near the drum tower in 
order to do a large-scale stall business. In the high bungalow, once a magician 
came to communicate. Xia Xingxing was a magician, and of course he taught me a 
lot of magic. The man brought a few steel rings and pulled them around. He 
became a blue boy, but he had no bottom. He said in jargon that how can a bottom 
be installed in the country? In fact, there is no bottom. This is &quot;yanjiangkou 
Lake&quot;. The secret of steel rings is that some steel rings have fractures, and 
other steel rings can be worn.<br>
<br>
Xia and I sometimes fly alone. Once at a bus stop, I just played chess, and the 
police&#39;s three wheeled motorcycle came. I was killed. Xia Yin just bought a 
bottle of snow cream in his hand. He said that I bought things, but I was not 
found. The policeman gave me back handcuffs, that is, put both hands on my back, 
once up and down, handcuff two thumbs, sit on a three wheeled motorcycle and 
take it to the police station.<br>
<br>
I said it was Jurong who played chess. They let me see how to get there. Chinese 
people all know how to play chess, and the police are also interested in it. I 
took several steps, but later I couldn&#39;t. It&#39;s said that ordinary people can&#39;t 
take this step.<br>
<br>
A policeman hit me in the mouth. The one on the side said don&#39;t hit me. Finally, 
they asked me to move a row of bricks in the yard and let me go.<br>
<br>
Yang and Gao Niu B do clothing business. They sell clothing wholesale, which is 
called &quot;tiaobao&quot;. Sometimes in the Confucius Temple, I act as a matchmaker. Once 
I went to Jiangning for an exchange meeting and bought a reduced measuring tape. 
For example, the measuring tape for pants showed three feet one, but the actual 
pants were only three feet, so I didn&#39;t go.<br>
<br>
Once Yang and I rode a tricycle to sell children&#39;s clothes. I took two of them 
as matchmakers. The police came. Yang ran on a tricycle and was caught up by the 
police. I also took my clothes and walked behind. The police asked me to put 
them on the tricycle, and Yang also asked me to put them on the car. I thought 
there was something important. In fact, it doesn&#39;t matter. If you pay a fine, 
you can get your tricycle and clothes back.<br>
<br>
In Gulou square, Xuming (who is older than us and in his 40s) has a stall 
license for a big stall. Gao Niu B and Yang decided to use his license to open a 
big stall. They are Xuming, Gao, Yang and me. I actually help. To be more 
accurate, I come to play.<br>
<br>
In a factory, we found a big white plastic bucket and soaked it in water for a 
day to clean it. I bought vegetables during the day and opened. When buying 
vegetables in the vegetable market, Yang Qi took three rounds. Because we bought 
a lot of vegetables, those who sold leeks saw it and said they would buy leeks. 
Yang said that the guests didn&#39;t order and refused.<br>
<br>
I beat rice in the canteen of Nanjing University. It was full of a huge steel 
pot. The girls had a small amount of food and had a balance of meal tickets. I 
asked for meal tickets from my good female classmates, such as dongjingping.<br>
<br>
On the first day, Gao Niu B hooked up with a prostitute and went to the house. 
Some prostitutes were looking for business at night market stalls. When I went 
back to my room, the prostitute had not left. She was in bed with her clothes 
on. She said something to Gao about the next time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter V<br>
<br>
There was a man like Hong Kong star linzixiang who once took a bath with Xia and 
me in the bathhouse. They usually pinched their feet. When chatting, Lin asked 
Xia to teach me Jianghu dialect, for example, the name of cigarettes is Cao 
Shanzi, and the name of matches is Ben Xingzi. &quot;Liu Yue Wang Zezhong&#39;s divine 
mind is open to love,&quot; that is, &quot;one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 
nine.&quot;. Ten yuan is called distance, and 100 yuan is called embryo. For example, 
Wang distance is 30 yuan, and Liu embryo is 100 yuan. When cheating gambling, 
the partner said, &quot;beat him first-class.&quot; That is to say, I cheated Kaizi of 10 
yuan, but Kaizi didn&#39;t understand.<br>
<br>
Linzixiang said that college students seem great, but in their eyes, they are 
all smelly shit.<br>
<br>
Lizi Pai is also called touch huazi. Once, when linzixiang ordered, Kaizi 
wouldn&#39;t let him go. Speaking of the police station, linzixiang was not afraid 
to go with him. Several people went with him. I went halfway and ran to a Book 
station to hide. Lin was fine afterwards.<br>
<br>
Once, I went to linzixiang&#39;s house with Liu&#39;s family name. Her second-hand wife 
was there. She said he had gone to play cards. Liu said, &quot;what cards do you play 
if you have a wife?&quot; Back at a dam, Liu asked me to ask his girlfriend out and 
pointed to the house. I went there. Two young men said she was not there.<br>
<br>
At the drum tower stall, I boasted: &quot;one day, I met Liu and pangxi, and I beat 
Liu down. Pangxi went with me.&quot; Liu was angry and immediately twisted my hand 
with the back of his hand. It still hurt. Gao Niu B: they are usually called 
hooligans. They all have experience and skills in fighting.<br>
<br>
Once Gao Niu B had a fight with a man in the drum tower. At first, I said not to 
fight. I dragged Gao. A man nearby said, &quot;you dragged him.&quot; I dragged the man 
again. The man asked me who I was? I said, &quot;old brother Xuming.&quot; He said, &quot;save 
your face.&quot; The two of them started to fight. There were about a dozen people 
watching. There were also people pushing bicycles. I told them to stay away. The 
second year of senior high school knocked him down. He fell to the ground and 
couldn&#39;t get up. Gao took out several Taiping fists.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, the man found someone to settle it. There was a treasure gourd on 
the high side. It was very strong. The man found a stronger one, but he knew 
baohulu and sat down. Gao Niu B knew the man a bit and said, &quot;he doesn&#39;t have to 
help me.&quot; Baohulu told him to shut up and the matter was settled.<br>
<br>
Once Gao Niu B brought an Anhui woman home with her Z. Later, I heard a woman 
from a neighbor say that the Anhui woman resisted and said that her sweater was 
torn. Gao said that I would buy you a new one. The Anhui woman left by herself 
and stood not far from the door for a while before she left alone.<br>
<br>
The stalls often fought. A middle-aged man was gentle. Two young people, who 
couldn&#39;t stand it, beat him. He fell to the ground and the two young people 
left. A helper came to wash dishes. He stayed for a day and stopped when he saw 
this.<br>
<br>
There is a prostitute who often comes to dinner. Her name is gaga. She is very 
dusty and has an aura. She says that it is good for her to be money. She has 
already made a fortune. She and Mao Mei on Zhujiang Road are two famous 
prostitutes in Nanjing. While sitting on the table, I touched Gaga&#39;s feet with 
my feet.<br>
<br>
There was a girl who was so ugly and chubby that dongjingping came to me to 
borrow a book. When she saw her near the square, she thought it could not be my 
girlfriend. I borrowed her poetry anthology from Beidao, which was given to me 
by gaobaoling, an American student. Later, I gave it to Shi lianlin, a writer in 
the same class as Dong. Later, I regretted that I should give it to Dong. They 
all like it. It can&#39;t be published in China because Dong and I have a very good 
relationship. I play magic. She rode out of school with me once and told her son 
to learn magic from me.<br>
<br>
I took the fat girl to Gao&#39;s house. There was a bed in the kitchen. I was also a 
high school student. I fell down on her. She resisted. Yang&#39;s girlfriend came 
and kept knocking on the door. She wanted to see Western scenery. I let the girl 
go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VI<br>
<br>
One time, I touched huazi with Xia and got Mao in the drum tower. The police 
asked Xia. I said I didn&#39;t know Xia. Xia escaped. On the way back to the police 
station, I felt sorry for an old beggar and said that the police didn&#39;t care 
about her. A policewoman happened to know liulimin, a Chinese 85. I said he was 
his good friend. He said something nice and let me go.<br>
<br>
There is a hooligan who likes to drink Yanghe and calls him Yanghe. Yanghe calls 
me &quot;maozi&quot; because I wear glasses, which is also a way for them to belittle 
college students.<br>
<br>
The meaning of hooligans living is to eat and drink w women. That&#39;s all for 
small talk. When a hooligan said that Z, he always brought a newspaper without 
getting dirty. Sometimes he was at someone else&#39;s house. Speaking of 
aphrodisiac, a hooligan said that he could not play. He was afraid that the 
female Kaizi would &quot;wake up&quot; and call the police.<br>
<br>
Hooligans call their friends old brothers, and their good friends absolute 
brothers. At the food stall, hooligans often see their friends coming and greet 
them or cook. They say they are my old brothers. Sometimes they emphasize 
absolute brothers.<br>
<br>
There is a Mazda driver who often comes to Gao Niu B&#39;s house. Shortly after he 
was released from prison, Pangpang, a prostitute said that she came out after 
she moved twice before he moved.<br>
<br>
Xia said that when they wandered in the Jianghu, of course, they didn&#39;t deposit 
their money in the bank. Instead, they buried their money under a tree and made 
a mark in the local area, such as Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing. They would come back 
to Nanjing later to dig it out. I don&#39;t know whether it was true or not.<br>
<br>
There was a little huazi, a little rascal, who helped at the stall. He said that 
when Gao Niu B had a fight with that man last time, if he wanted to be present, 
he would kill him and wave his hand. In business partnership, if someone 
swallows money privately, it is called &quot;playing the old nest&quot;. My classmates 
Linyi and caorei came to the stall to play with me. I told them about playing 
Laowo. Xiaohuazi thought I said he played Laowo and scolded me. He thought Lin 
Yi was worried. He wrote a note and asked me to give it to Lin Yi. Of course, I 
ignored him. Two days later, he thought Lin Yi looked at him more and thought 
the note was effective. Thank me.<br>
<br>
The stalls are usually cooked by Yang Xiaxia. I also cooked noodles and 
vegetables for the guests. Once I cooked soup, I put soy sauce in it. Gao said 
not to put it. The man didn&#39;t blame it. Of course, it was cooked meat oil. Once 
they joked that I might become president in the future. I said that if I became 
president, I would kill all of you. I meant to leave no stain on myself. I don&#39;t 
know if they heard it.<br>
<br>
When there are no guests in the stall, I often sing the song of panmeichen, &quot;I 
want to have a home, a place that doesn&#39;t need to be gorgeous. When I am tired, 
I will think of it...&quot;<br>
<br>
If a well-dressed guest comes to the stall and looks like an overseas Chinese in 
Hong Kong and Taiwan, I will put the price list away. If the guest asks for the 
price, he will increase the price. This is &quot;foreign dish&quot;, which originally 
meant to increase the price for foreigners. Once such a few people came to my 
restaurant and they ate it.<br>
<br>
Family members of patients often come to Gulou Hospital for dinner. They order 
rice and soup instead of vegetables. Gao is unwilling to come next time and must 
order vegetables.<br>
<br>
A rogue with a gauze wrapped around his arm was injured. He wanted to go to the 
hospital and asked me to borrow money. I borrowed it in the money box. Gao 
blamed me. I said he was hurt and pitied. He said who pitied you.<br>
<br>
Once at a stall, a woman walked by with a kettle in her hand. A hooligan shouted 
&quot;lift the kettle&quot;. The woman scolded. Lifting the kettle means Z.<br>
<br>
Educated guests, seeing that I am a college student, often chat with me. Because 
before long, someone asked the students whether they supported the Asian Games? 
When I said support, he praised me.<br>
<br>
Because I don&#39;t take money, I just do it for fun. Once Xuming was connecting the 
power line. I sat down. He said I didn&#39;t do anything, so I poured out a steel 
pot full of rice I had played in the school canteen. He said that Gao Niu B had 
to cook. I also want to clean. One person said no, someone will come to pick it 
up right away, pointing to an old lady picking it up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VII<br>
<br>
My female classmates Linyi, caolai and Shan Xiaopeng often come to the stall to 
play with me, so I&#39;ll give them something to eat. Since Shan Xiaopeng and Cao 
Lei are close friends, I am close to Lin Yi. In fact, Cao Lei is better to me. 
Once, I gave Lin Yi a whole sausage and pressed it at the bottom of the bowl.<br>
<br>
A hooligan, nicknamed Tang Jishi, is very handsome. He often comes to the stalls 
with people. One day, Lin Yi and his colleagues came. Tang Jishi played with the 
hooligans, sat holding Lin Yi&#39;s hand and said that the young lady was beautiful 
(at that time, the young lady was not a derogatory term). Lin Yi had no choice 
but smiled foolishly. I stopped him and said good things to Tang Jishi<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
, said that my classmate was a college student. I couldn&#39;t do that. Tang Jishi 
didn&#39;t want to give up. Finally, I resolutely stopped him. Tang Jishi just let 
Lin Yi go. He said that college students were bad for him. The hooligans called 
me a college student. Afterwards, Shan Xiaopeng said he wanted to rush up, but 
you, a college student, fought with the hooligans<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, definitely not.<br>
<br>
The hooligans always gather and disperse from time to time. Today these three 
people are together, and tomorrow the five people are together. They all have 
their own circles, and the people in the circles also repeat.<br>
<br>
There were two hooligans, both handsome and beautiful girlfriends. They said 
that Tongtou, a friend, was in the same room with several people. Many enemies 
killed him. One of them was Tongtou&#39;s friend. When he saw that Tongtou was also 
there, he shouted, &quot;Tongtou, run away.&quot; Copper head ran away at the sound. It is 
estimated that other people also know that copper head is<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
His friend, let go of Tongtou, and the rest will suffer.<br>
<br>
Two girlfriends are women from Yunnan. One night, one of them was at the stall, 
because they also became enmity. Rogue enmity is a kind of enmity between 
rogues, competing for venues and women. You are an ordinary person, and Rogues 
will not become enmity with you. Gao Niu B asked me to take the woman home<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fang) said a man would give it better. It was drizzling. I shared an umbrella 
with the woman and walked along an alley in the drum tower. She said she was 
from Yunnan. I boasted that I had been to Yunnan, but immediately revealed that 
I had been to Guilin in Yunnan.<br>
<br>
Gao Niu B said when chatting that women are better and more attentive to you. 
They sang a song, but they couldn&#39;t sing it completely. I could only say, &quot;but 
she, she, left me behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Lizi card was discovered at the central gate bus station. In my Jianghu years, 
I was the only one who was discovered every time. Maybe it was a high 
probability of being arrogant. I said that I was tolerant. I didn&#39;t say that 
there was an accomplice to cheat gambling. I said that the player who played the 
last chess game let me go.<br>
<br>
At school, I imitated the &quot;thousand rivers and thousands of mountains always 
love&quot; and sang a yellow song &quot;RB song&quot;<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t tell me how much trouble RB takes, r your mother, r your milk<br>
<br>
Old ladies and children can also RB<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t be afraid that the hanging child r breaks the virginity Mo, big B and big 
d are always r<br>
<br>
RB also wants to R every day. R dies and r lives<br>
<br>
Big r eighty rounds.<br>
<br>
He sings with a smile, but he can&#39;t laugh at last. The word &quot;Eighty rounds&quot; 
doesn&#39;t mean singing. Dai Er recorded my voice. During the summer vacation, he 
played my voice in a school and then recorded it for us. When I listened to it, 
the girls giggled in my song.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VIII<br>
<br>
During the summer vacation, most of the students went home. Xia, Gao Niu B and 
Xiao Xue often slept in our school. Qin Yibin, a fellow countryman and senior 
student, gave me an empty dormitory key and we slept in it.<br>
<br>
One morning, several of us were sleeping soundly. In a dream, the school 
security office knocked on the door to check. It was teacher lvxiaoping (in 
charge of student work). He first called the school guard. Because the school 
guard was my friend, I organized a movie at the school to let them guard the 
door, which gave them a lot of benefits. The school guard was unwilling to 
interfere with me and ignored him. This was what the school guard told me 
afterwards.<br>
<br>
The school security office took us to the security office. Gao Niu B and Xiao 
Xue reported other people&#39;s names as usual. Xia had a suitcase, all of which 
were magic props. He had an Anhui Township certificate, saying it was a 
magician. Please go to the office for convenience. The school security office 
told me that the beggars in Anhui also had proof and let us go.<br>
<br>
Xia started her old profession, taught me magic, and opened the first magic 
training class with me. She printed a stack of paper advertisements and posted 
them on the campus. In addition to us at Nanjing University, there were also 
Nanshi, Hehai, Southeast, etc. even a girl named Caiyan from Nanshi came to 
learn magic. I took her to a movie. She was not good-looking, a little plump, 
but very feminine.<br>
<br>
We also printed the words of the magic class on our clothes. My college 
graduation photo, the 2-inch black-and-white photo in white, and the mirror 
waterstop netizen said that the sharp edges and corners were actually green, 
with the red words of the magic class printed on it.<br>
<br>
Xia has a bottle of water. It says what medicine it is. It makes me smell it. I 
feel dizzy. It is harmful.<br>
<br>
At the stall, Gao Niu B said to Yang, &quot;Xuming doesn&#39;t know we work for him.&quot; 
Later, I wondered if it was me. This stall is for testing me.<br>
<br>
One night, when Lin Zixiang and I were late (just in my senior year), we fell 
down on the bed in my dormitory. In summer, we didn&#39;t use quilts. I put a bench 
beside the bed. The student bed was not wide. Lin and I just lay down. My 
roommate wouldn&#39;t let us. I said, &quot;my friend can&#39;t sleep in my bed all night?&quot;? 
&quot;My roommates are determined not to let me go. They exclude people from society. 
They don&#39;t have as much contact as I do. They are also a little afraid. 
Linzixiang had to leave.<br>
<br>
Hooligans also have three great pleasures in life. In Xia&#39;s words, they are: 
rely on B, pinch their feet and pull out their ears:) he emphasizes that rely on 
B is the first:)<br>
<br>
Xia was about to leave. Gao Niu B and I, two &quot;apprentices&quot;, saw him off. We 
bought some vegetables at a restaurant at the central gate bus station and 
brought back some wine. We took the restaurant bowl and gave a deposit of 2 
yuan. The next day, I went to return the bowl, but I didn&#39;t return the deposit. 
I was young and vigorous. The hotel called the police. The police just called me 
last time. I argued that it was my brother who played chess and I was a college 
student. Maybe my performance was lifelike. The police believed me and let me 
go. Of course, I don&#39;t want the 2 yuan deposit anymore.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s a bit strange. I was assigned to Zhenjiang (provincial agricultural means 
of production), but Xia found my company&#39;s phone number and address. In the 
summer of 1991, I came to my company to find me. I started to check in with my 
company, but I didn&#39;t know how to get there. He called me first and said he 
wouldn&#39;t go up on the third floor. He was jealous of &quot;3&quot; and waited downstairs 
for me to get off work. I was uncomfortable and took it as a trouble. When I 
went downstairs, I envied Wang Zhengping, my colleague downstairs, No trouble. I 
took Xia to the dormitory, then went to a small restaurant on Nanmen Street for 
a drink, took him to a bus stop at dashikou, and he went to the railway station.<br>
<br>
The next afternoon, when I was at work, Xia called and said that the railway 
station police station had investigated him. He had long hair at that time (he 
seemed to have long hair all the time). He took the guitar I gave him when I 
left and asked me to prove to him that it was my master. Then I called the 
police. The police asked me, and I said, &quot;master, master, master, I learned 
magic from him.&quot; Because I was a work phone, the police let him go. After a 
while, Xia called again to thank me for using a public phone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IX<br>
<br>
After dinner at Lao Yang&#39;s house, we chatted at the door. Lao Ren said, &quot;in our 
business, if anyone needs money badly, he can keep all the money. Just take care 
of everyone&#39;s meals.&quot; I lost my movie ticket and needed money. That&#39;s why I 
entered the Jianghu, but I didn&#39;t say.<br>
<br>
Xiao Xue said that when Lao Ren was acting as a shelf, he said to Kaizi, &quot;I&#39;m 
going to move this game of chess.&quot; It means that each child must move before it 
can finish.<br>
<br>
Gao Niu B fell at the door. Lao Ren said, &quot;I deeply mourn Comrade Gao Niu B.&quot; it 
was quite formal and funny.<br>
<br>
There is a saying in the Jianghu that &quot;golden March, Silver March, eating March 
and playing March. &quot;Spring is the golden March and autumn is the Silver March. 
The temperature in these two seasons is suitable for cheating money. In winter, 
it is March. It is not suitable to set up a stall on the street in cold weather. 
It is not suitable to eat and drink at home. In summer, it is March to play. It 
is also not suitable to set up a stall in high temperature. It is not suitable 
to play outside.<br>
<br>
The hooligans know the name of every woman passing by. When they wear red 
clothes, they call her &quot;Xiao Hong&quot; and when they wear yellow clothes, they call 
her &quot;Xiao Huang&quot;... And so on:)<br>
<br>
In the evening, I was in the dormitory, playing the residual game with my 
classmate jiangsuping. No matter I played black or red chess, he always lost. He 
played the opposite game to imitate my previous game. I changed a little, and he 
lost again. The Chinese chess residual game is still very scientific. You must 
play each step correctly and know the changes of each step.<br>
<br>
Once in the dormitory, classmates Dai Yong and jiangsuping sold old clothes to 
Gao Niu B and Xiao Xue. Three Wen was not worth two Wen. Gao Niu B shouted for a 
bargain and bought a lot.<br>
<br>
I lost money because I lost my movie tickets. I was young and ignorant. I stayed 
in the bank like in American movies and followed an old lady who withdrew money. 
Fortunately, I didn&#39;t commit a crime because of my conscience! I also went to 
the mall. In front of me, several people put a bag on the counter. A man in the 
back immediately came to pick up the bag and left. I was so scared that I left 
quickly. After thinking about it, it was like a deliberate show to me.<br>
<br>
Many years later, Wang Daquan, the village head of my hometown, came to my house 
to play and said, &quot;you can&#39;t blame the thief. There&#39;s no living expenses. You 
have to live.&quot; This is why I say that thieves are not outstanding communist 
soldiers. It is also the reason why I want to realize a communist society. Only 
a communist society can guarantee the basic life of all people.<br>
<br>
At that time, there were a large number of thieves in Nanjing, known as &quot;Yong 
Ma&quot;. At that time, the bus got on and off at the front and back doors at the 
same time. There were ticket sellers in the bus to buy tickets. Getting on and 
off the bus at the same time is a good opportunity for thieves to start. At that 
time, the buses were crowded. Kaizi got off the bus and yongma got on the bus. 
There was an obvious touch. Yongma took Kaizi&#39;s wallet. It was too crowded to 
find it. On the contrary, Kaizi got on the bus and yongma got off the bus. It 
was the same.<br>
<br>
Once when Xia and I got off the bus, a yong ma he knew got off the bus and said, 
&quot;almost got it.&quot; He was also frustrated by a mistake.<br>
<br>
On one bus ride, a local young man in Nanjing shouted on the bus: &quot;Beware of 
brave horses. There are many brave horses.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that time, it was common for the bus to evade tickets and shout about monthly 
tickets (in Nanjing dialect, ha ha). Once Xia and I got off the bus, and he 
left. I was checked. I said that the ticket was on the person in front of me, 
and shouted at the people in front of me. I didn&#39;t succeed. I gave the bad watch 
I cheated on gambling to the ticket checker, pretended to continue chasing the 
person in front, and left.<br>
<br>
In Xinjiekou, some women sell the latest status of Hua Guofeng and the gang of 
four. They write a sign for one yuan. Kaizi buys it and gives it a piece of 
printed paper, that is, in the newspaper. Wang Hongwen is in prison.<br>
<br>
Some women sell mahjong secrets, which are also printed on a piece of paper. For 
example, &quot;starting to listen to cards&quot; is to prepare a handful of listened cards 
to hide on their bodies and change them. Once when Kaizi found out that she had 
been cheated and caught the woman, I went forward to persuade her. Afterwards, 
they said I was good at Mandarin.<br>
<br>
Once at Gao Niu B&#39;s house, he saw a group photo. Gao Niu B said that a man had 
lost his target. He wanted to run away and killed the people who blocked him 
with a knife. Gao said that he could not run away without killing.<br>
<br>
Although the homicide cases must be solved, many of them can not be solved, and 
the perpetrators are at large. This is also the reason why the most vicious 
people would rather kill than escape. In my hometown, Dazhuo Township, Jurong, 
Jiangsu Province, there are three homicide cases that have not been solved for 
more than 20 years. One is that the husband and wife of shishantou post office 
were killed. They didn&#39;t say the password of the cash box. The villagers 
couldn&#39;t live after talking about it. Later, their son took the post. One was a 
dance dispute. A man was killed. At that time, the case was solved. 
Qingzhuannian in relevant areas had blood tests, such as my little uncle.<br>
<br>
Even when cadres from above came to our village to collect fees, some villagers 
said, &quot;you only know how to collect fees. You can&#39;t solve any murder cases.&quot; The 
cadres were speechless.<br>
<br>

Volume 3: Ge Shenyi&#39;s hearsay: flying over the madhouse(december1990 – present)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter I<br>
<br>
He graduated from university in July, 1990. In August, he was assigned to 
Zhenjiang Management Department of Jiangsu agricultural means of production 
company and engaged in secretarial work. When I reported for duty, I took a bus 
from my hometown of Jurong to Zhenjiang and got to dashikou. I didn&#39;t know how 
to get there. However, I walked along the street to the Fifth Ring club on 
Jiankang road. I looked up and saw the company card. I didn&#39;t go wrong at all.<br>
<br>
As a student of the June 4th movement, I began to study with two technical 
secondary school students (dingdebin and Zhou Zheng) for three days, that is, an 
old secretary (xiaorenkui) read newspapers, and then went to Yangzhou Shiqiao 
warehouse for internship.<br>
<br>
After returning to town, he worked in the human secretary department. In the 
dormitory, I saw a paper top-grade song list, which was to list the songs that 
would be popular. It was very exquisite and beautiful. I had never seen such a 
song list before or after.<br>
<br>
On December 4, he Geng went to Suzhou on business with the leaders. He Geng 
drove a small overlord van to attend the provincial agricultural means of 
production meeting. The manager of the provincial agricultural means of 
production made a speech. He remembered how to distinguish fake and shoddy 
pesticides. He said it very well. I recorded the tape. I thought the tape was 
almost finished. I changed it. In the evening, I listened to the tape and wrote 
the speech. It was written by caiguangyi, who was then the chief of the Human 
Resources Secretary section.<br>
<br>
There were some strange things at that time. We couldn&#39;t hear the manager&#39;s Wuxi 
dialect clearly. Cai even scolded his mother. At dinner, I don&#39;t know who gave 
Cai a piece of meat, but Cai asked lulixin, &quot;what did you do?&quot;, Lu is the deputy 
manager.<br>
<br>
Somehow, I was very excited. My brother&#39;s classmates in Suzhou came to the hotel 
to see me. I asked them to wash their faces. In the hotel ballroom at night, I 
grabbed the first dance floor and danced disco.<br>
<br>
Excited, I didn&#39;t sleep well. The next morning, I was in the park. It seemed 
that I was singing. I was a wolf from the north. Zhou Zheng asked me to go to 
the toilet and said to meet a person who would affect my future, like CAI.<br>
<br>
They drove back to town first. Later, manager Lu and I took the train back to 
town. It was strange to see a pile of fire all the way. It should be burning 
straw.<br>
<br>
When I returned to town, I was always excited. There was a blank paper in the 
door of the dormitory. My brother and I were having dinner in a restaurant at 
night. The boss said &quot;dog meat dog meat&quot; loudly because my last name is ge. In 
the morning in the dormitory, I heard that the school played a high pitched 
loudspeaker, saying that the newly graduated college students or something. The 
unit found a relationship and gave me a kind of medicine. Of course, I didn&#39;t 
take it because I could do magic. I pressed my mouth when I ate it, and then 
vomited it out.<br>
<br>
On the morning of December 14 (the later religious Good Friday), caiguangyi, 
wumingsuo and my brother took me to the car. Zhuguojing drove. When entering the 
yard, Wu covered my eyes. I saw several large red characters of Zhenjiang 
psychiatric hospital, arched above the road.<br>
<br>
After entering the hospital ward, they all left. An old man (patient) came to 
the room, held my hand and asked me if I knew where this was? When I said 
hospital, he tried hard and said it was the secret service.<br>
<br>
Because the door was closed, I couldn&#39;t get out, so I asked the doctor to let me 
out. They ignored me. I said to the doctor and nurse, &quot;if you don&#39;t let me out, 
I&#39;ll take off my clothes one by one until I&#39;m done.&quot;. When they still ignored 
the trample, I was very angry and began to take off my clothes. I just took off 
two pieces. A doctor (Zhouhai) said, put them on and let you out.<br>
<br>
As soon as I was dressed, several doctors, nurses, nurses, nurses and patients 
gathered around me and grabbed me. I didn&#39;t resist. I was tied to the bed with a 
long cloth belt, tied my limbs and shins, and gave me an electric needle. It was 
an electrified instrument. Several needles were inserted into my head, causing 
unspeakable pain. The whole head had no concept of mouth, ear, nose and eye. It 
was like a big iron frame. There was a big hammer stirring in it, sometimes 
contracting pain, sometimes radiating pain. He asked me what the place was. I 
said the hospital, but they didn&#39;t stop electroacupuncture. I just told the old 
man that it was the Security Bureau.<br>
<br>
I heard a young woman&#39;s voice: &quot;Ge Yimin is good&quot;, like that of xuhaiying.<br>
<br>
After the electroacupuncture, all my tears and snot came out. Then my brother 
came to wipe it for me. It turned out that he hadn&#39;t gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter II<br>
<br>
Because I have done terrible electroacupuncture, I am honest. Old patients are 
honest because of it. When new patients come in, they are dishonest. They all do 
electroacupuncture and are honest as soon as they do it. When chatting, several 
old patients said that there was an electric shock, which was even more 
terrible. It was like falling off a cliff.<br>
<br>
The work and rest of mental hospitals are very regular. They compete with 
prisons and guards, and the same thing is the loss of freedom.<br>
<br>
The patient activity area is divided into two parts, one is the sleeping room, 
the other is the activity room, which is the place to stay during the day.<br>
<br>
In winter, it is dark. You get up before 6 o&#39;clock. The quilt is folded by the 
nurse or the old patient. In winter, you cover two quilts. The nurse has a 
unique way to fold the quilt.<br>
<br>
Get up and wash. The toothpaste is for public use. There is an old patient who 
keeps it. He can only squeeze you less than the size of soybeans. After 
finishing your face and teeth, go into the activity room for breakfast.<br>
<br>
It was still dark. One person stood in line with a porcelain basin and 
chopsticks. The health worker brought breakfast in his car. There was porridge 
in a stainless steel box and steamed bread in a drawer. When one person makes a 
bowl of porridge, the health worker grabs some small dishes, usually a small 
amount of dried carrots, two steamed buns, and finds a seat to eat. The dishes 
and chopsticks are washed by an old patient on duty, but they can&#39;t be cleaned 
at all.<br>
<br>
After eating, I waited for the doctor&#39;s rounds at 8:15, bored. Doctors and 
nurses go to work at 8 o&#39;clock and have a morning meeting. The health worker 
takes the new patient to meet him. The room is full of white coats, which is 
very impressive.<br>
<br>
Each patient has his own doctor. A doctor has about 10 patients. The doctor went 
round the room and asked his patient, &quot;all right?&quot;, The patient replied, &quot;OK&quot;, 
this is the ward round.<br>
<br>
At 9 o&#39;clock, the nurse took a box containing various cigarettes to give out 
cigarettes. The family members kept six cigarettes for each person, which was an 
important ceremony in the mental hospital. The patient had already smoked six 
cigarettes yesterday, waiting for this moment. There are new patients who want 
to smoke. The nurse said, &quot;you don&#39;t have any cigarettes at home.&quot; Send away.<br>
<br>
Patients are not allowed to bring lighters. The nurses will light the cigarette. 
After the cigarette is finished, those who have just smoked will find the nurses 
to light it. They dare to be addicted. They smoke six cigarettes a day.<br>
<br>
Then there was boredom, waiting for lunch. At 10:40, we had lunch. Everyone sat 
down. The health worker pushed the car. There were several drawers of steamed 
rice, a bucket of inedible vegetables, and star point meat. At this time, 
doctors and nurses came to help. There were also old patients. They put several 
pots on a tray and brought them to the patients.<br>
<br>
After lunch, I lined up to take medicine. The old patient took a handful of 
medicine given by the nurse in his left hand and water in his right hand, and 
ate it all. I have never taken any medicine before. I can&#39;t take any medicine. I 
sit next to the nurse and take it one by one. Some old patients laugh at me for 
taking pills.<br>
<br>
After taking medicine, I took a nap in the sleeping room. Some people did not 
sleep and chatted.<br>
<br>
At 1:30 p.m., when you get up and go to the activity room, the first thing is to 
send snacks, that is, the family members store snacks. The nursing workers and 
specific elderly patients call their names according to the order in which they 
put snacks on the shelves. What do the called newspapers take. Some old 
patients, who have no snacks, are also crowded. They want others to share some 
of them, sometimes they grab some.<br>
<br>
There was an old patient who was hospitalized for a long time. He called the Xu 
family. I saw that he called the Xu family. When I wanted to go home, I said 
that the Xu family would bring an apple.<br>
<br>
At 2 o&#39;clock, the family will meet. My mother will send me delicious food every 
day. She will take a thermos, chicken, ribs and some fruit. Sometimes my brother 
takes a rest and he comes to see him off.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I was still bored. There were two big red kidney baths. 
Everyone washed their feet in hot water. Many people didn&#39;t wash at all. 
Sometimes the nurses saw it and said that it was not smelly if they didn&#39;t wash 
it. They still didn&#39;t wash it. There was an old patient who gave out straw 
paper. One piece of straw paper was torn into two and a half pieces, half for 
each person.<br>
<br>
Dinner at 4:40. Dinner is the same as breakfast. A bowl of porridge and two 
steamed buns. After dinner, take medicine, and then go back to the sleeping room 
to rest. Because it was early, we chatted in twos and threes. But because of 
taking medicine, we all went to bed early. The sleeping time was 8 o&#39;clock, but 
most people went to bed early.<br>
<br>
Get up the next morning and repeat the previous day and every day.<br>
<br>
I am a situational disorder, to put it more seriously, manic depression (bipolar 
affective psychosis).<br>
<br>
On December 21 (later, the holy Easter), the nurse told me not to eat breakfast 
and left me alone in the bedroom.<br>
<br>
After waiting for a long time, a group of doctors and nurses came in. Several 
doctors pressed me, held my head, inserted a needle in my head, and put a small 
wooden board in my mouth. I struggled. I didn&#39;t know what they were doing. There 
were too many of them to support. The struggle failed, and then I lost 
consciousness.<br>
<br>
When I woke up, the hygienist told me to have a cold breakfast.<br>
<br>
This is electroconvulsive. It doesn&#39;t feel like falling off a cliff as the old 
patient said. After power on, you lose consciousness. You are in shock, like 
falling asleep, or like dying. Wake up in an hour. This is what I later claimed 
to be on the cross, dead and raised.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter III<br>
<br>
Mental hospitals, prisons and detention centers also have one thing in common, 
that is, it is better to have family members to visit them, and it is better to 
have family members to save money and things. The &quot;three noes&quot; (no one to visit, 
no one to save money, no one to save things) are suffering. They are faced with 
food that can no longer be worse every day, and they are destitute every day. 
There is no hope and no hope. Some &quot;three noes&quot; have delusions that others will 
give them something to eat, but those who have food can join forces to adjust 
the money and exchange what they need. They are called &quot;coming and going&quot;. It is 
very unlikely that the &quot;three noes&quot; can get some rewards. I am kind-hearted. 
People often visit me and save money. I bought fried rice with eggs and duck 
blood Vermicelli Soup for an old man with no staff and an orphan boy. Once nurse 
Jia Jianqing saw the stop and said to me, &quot;if they can eat enough, they can do 
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of the three no smoking people are addicted to smoking, so they can only 
wait until the end of smoking. When there is a little, they come up to discuss. 
They say that there is no more. They receive two cigarettes and smoke until the 
sponge burns their mouth. Often when one smokes, two or three no smoking people 
wait. Sometimes they have to grab cigarette butts.<br>
<br>
Because six cigarettes a day is not enough. Some patients smoke half of them, 
put them out with their hands, and smoke the other half next time. In this way, 
they can smoke six cigarettes 12 times. After 12 times of addiction, sometimes 
they still have a cigarette end to light cigarettes. The nurses are also funny.<br>
<br>
There is an unwritten rule in the mental hospital, and it is an iron law. People 
who have no family members to pick them up can not get out of the hospital. 
Those who are in stable condition can not get out of the hospital even if they 
are cured. The reason is that there will be problems when they go out without 
supervision and supervision. For example, they have no means of living, such as 
endangering the society. As a result, some patients were hospitalized for a long 
time, even for a lifetime, until they died in the hospital.<br>
<br>
All mental patients have a guardian who cannot leave the hospital without his 
consent. Huxiaohu is a top student in the Civil Engineering Department of 
Southeast University. There are buildings designed by him in Zhenjiang. What 
middle school. His brother is a guardian and doesn&#39;t agree with him leaving the 
hospital. His mother comes to see him every day, cooks vegetables for him, and 
leaves some snacks, such as bread. But more than 20 years later, his mother 
died, and he still lives in the hospital.<br>
<br>
Zhangyoulong is an adopted son, and his brother doesn&#39;t pick him up. It&#39;s rare 
to see him. Once he brought very few roast ducks, so that the health worker said 
they were leftovers. Zhangyoulong is a Christian. He doesn&#39;t ask for cigarettes. 
Sometimes people give him cigarettes. He says that if someone gives him 
cigarettes, he will smoke them. If not, he will have &quot;Kangpi&quot;.<br>
<br>
Xieping is a technical secondary school student and used to be a teacher. His 
brother is in Hong Kong. Neither his brother nor his uncle will pick him up. 
Because it was at public expense, he said that the elderly care in the hospital 
was very good. When he got sick, for example, he was treated by a doctor and 
took medicine. He gave up his freedom.<br>
<br>
If the guardian doesn&#39;t answer, he&#39;s just afraid to take it back and separate 
his family, give him a place to live and get him food. He&#39;s simply locked up in 
the hospital. Of course, these patients are treated at public expense.<br>
<br>
When I was admitted to the hospital, there were three young nurses, huqimei, 
shilianghua and taolingwei. Huqimei was my junior sister. She was a junior high 
school student at Dazhuo middle school in Jurong county. She was also 
sunzhaopin&#39;s student, several years younger than me. They were all assigned to 
the hospital after graduation from the health school.<br>
<br>
Taolingwei taught me to sing in her spare time. At that time, I had long hair. 
Later, she watched the long hair of Hong Kong stars on TV and said: &quot;when GE 
Yimin first came, it was like this.&quot; She has tetracycline teeth.<br>
<br>
She taught me a lot of songs. In the early 1990s, Hong Kong and Taiwan songs 
were very popular. What impressed me deeply was &quot;in the rain&quot;, &quot;I sent you in 
the rain, I kissed you at night, I owned you in spring, and I left you in 
winter.&quot; She sings one sentence, and I learn one from her. Many years later, I 
saw that her position was always not promoted, but huqimei and Shi Lianghua were 
both promoted. She said, &quot;it&#39;s enough for me to control you, Ge Yimin.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IV<br>
<br>
Mental hospitals have a unique place. In society, even in schools, people wear 
masks, as do prisons and detention centers. Only mental hospitals do not need 
masks. If you are in the mood, you can completely let go of your original self 
and be happy wantonly, because you don&#39;t have to guard against anyone. I once 
told my mother that it was the place where I had the most fun and laughter and 
wanted to go.<br>
<br>
There was a man like Zhang Yimou. I stood in front of the window with him and 
saw a woman on the road. I said, &quot;he&#39;s Zhang Yimou. Please ask him for his 
signature.&quot; the woman said, &quot;why don&#39;t you ask him for his signature?&quot; I said, 
&quot;I am much bigger than him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once I was standing in front of the window, a woman passed by, dressed in red, 
in her 30s, very beautiful. I shouted to her, &quot;Xiao Hong, don&#39;t think you are 
dressed in red, I don&#39;t know you. You are my wife.&quot; She thought my words were 
very interesting, so she immediately repeated them to passers-by: &quot;he said:&quot; 
Xiao Hong, don&#39;t think you are dressed in red, I don&#39;t know you. You are my 
wife. &quot; He smiled and bent over.<br>
<br>
There was a woman who sold newspapers. Once I stood at the window and shouted to 
her, &quot;newspaper seller.&quot;. &quot;She thought I wanted to buy a newspaper, so she came 
over. I said,&quot; super your mother. &quot;When she found out that she had been cheated, 
she immediately scolded her.<br>
<br>
Next to our ward is the girls&#39; dormitory of Zhenjiang teachers&#39; college. In the 
evening, girls go to self-study. I like a girl. She steps on her left leg, I 
shout &quot;left&quot;, she steps on her right leg, I shout &quot;right&quot;, I shout from left to 
right, and her legs don&#39;t listen to me. She stomps her feet and bends down to 
laugh.<br>
<br>
Nurse Wu Dan is very kind to me. She often gives me leftovers, such as instant 
noodles. She is very beautiful, and I care more about her saliva. Even a health 
worker&#39;s aunt was so disgusted that she said, &quot;give him the leftovers. &quot;I only 
ate her leftovers once. Maybe they went bad and made me vomit.<br>
<br>
After taking a nap, I took my temperature and reported my stool. Wu Dan asked me 
to ask about my stool. She remembered. For example, when I called &quot;huxiaohu&quot;, he 
replied &quot;once&quot;, and then I called &quot;Xieping&quot;, and he replied &quot;no&quot;. After calling 
several people, I suddenly called &quot;Wu Dan&quot;. She should say, thinking I had 
something to do, I shouted: &quot;shit&quot;, and she laughed.<br>
<br>
There was a man like zhangxinzhe. I was lying in bed. He was lying beside my 
bed. Because he was too close, the nurse wouldn&#39;t allow him to get up. He is so 
much like zhangxinzhe that I said to guohongmei and Dongyan, my sister hair 
salons in Changzhou bull running, that I had met zhangxinzhe.<br>
<br>
Once a man came in. He was really a star. Now he can&#39;t remember his name. Let&#39;s 
call him Zhang Hui. The girls of teachers&#39; College knew that I was at the 
window. Several girls called me Zhang Hui. I called Zhang Hui. Zhang sat not far 
away and said to me, &quot;just say I&#39;m not here.&quot;. I said loudly to the girl, &quot;he 
said he wasn&#39;t here.&quot; The girls giggled. Zhang Hui had to come over and talk to 
the girls.<br>
<br>
Later, several girls really brought flowers to see him. He sat down with them at 
the reception place and really looked like a star meeting fans.<br>
<br>
A man had a bad leg and quarreled with Zhang Hui. Zhang Hui beat him. He took a 
rice bowl and smashed Zhang Hui. I pulled it off because I thought the man was 
my classmate Guan Hong&#39;s brother. Zhanghui asked me why I turned to him? I said, 
&quot;he is disabled.&quot;.<br>
<br>
Later, the man&#39;s father came to see him, and he really looked like Guan Hong&#39;s 
father, Guan Hong (my high school geography teacher). I went to the reception 
room to talk to him. He smiled and asked me not to interfere with his meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter V<br>
<br>
There was a health worker, especially like Andy Lau. Once I went back to 
Zhenjiang from my hometown in Jurong, and I took a bus with him. He also said 
that there were &quot;stones&quot; all the way, including stone hills, stone horses and 
stone hillocks. Once, when I was noisy, he covered my head with a quilt, took it 
to the bed and bound me, and I shouted for help. He asked me to do things for 
him. For example, he dragged the stairs early in the morning. I believe I can&#39;t 
run. What&#39;s the point of running?<br>
<br>
He said he was on the night shift. He took the lead in sleeping. Once, I took an 
old man into the ward without permission (that is, the old man from the Security 
Bureau told me) and locked the old man and another confused patient in the 
kitchen. They fooled around and said that they would fight poison with poison. 
Director Tian Zhihong of the ward asked him to send the old man back, saying 
that the fare would not be reimbursed.<br>
<br>
There was a nurse named jiajianqing who rode a motorcycle to work in the 
morning. She had a very good relationship with me, so that later, director 
quhongfang said, &quot;geyimin, you should be good, or I&#39;m sorry for Xiao Jia.&quot; Once, 
I said, &quot;I want to transfer 100 million yuan, buy the fourth hospital, and let 
nurse Jia be the president.&quot; Health worker Li said, &quot;what about you?&quot; I 
hurriedly said, &quot;the dean&#39;s husband.&quot; Nurse Jia immediately smiled and bent 
over.<br>
<br>
Once, when the patient chatted, I said, &quot;nurse Jia B treated others like R, but 
not me like R.&quot; An old man said, &quot;nurse Jia is married.&quot; I said, &quot;that&#39;s why B 
treats others as R, not me as R.&quot;<br>
<br>
I often help in the hospital and am a model worker. For example, tying people, 
using a urinal to collect urine for patients (tying, hanging water, etc.), and 
even when leaving the hospital, a nurse said, I&#39;m gone, and no one can help me. 
The advantage is that you can eat more good food. And washing dishes. Sometimes 
I contract to wash dishes three times a day, and they are all on duty.<br>
<br>
There was one person tied up. There were several tied up in the hospital. When I 
saw that the person was thin, I said it was enough for me to be alone. He went 
up and helped him to the bed. The nurse tied him up. He suddenly threw up my 
face.<br>
<br>
There was a policeman who came to the hospital wearing a police uniform. Several 
of us went to tie him up. He was very strong. I was still talking to him. A 
doctor suddenly jumped at him. We rushed forward. A female relative of him said, 
watch out for his hand. It&#39;s hurt.<br>
<br>
The policeman knew that the electroacupuncture was powerful, but he said he was 
not afraid. He also asked me to do it to experience my feeling. He specifically 
asked me to watch it when I did it, but I didn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
Once, I was unhappy with the police. I was eating ducks. He wanted to ask for a 
few pieces. I refused to give them. I also told nurse Jia sitting opposite that 
she couldn&#39;t eat them. Jia laughed.<br>
<br>
All the floor mopping was done by patients. Several regular old patients did. 
After the doctor checked the room, the health worker called us to mop the floor.<br>
<br>
One morning, a doctor asked me to take out the garbage. The paper box in the 
doctor&#39;s and nurse&#39;s office was full of bananas and other garbage.<br>
<br>
Once it seemed that my &quot;master&quot; xialiwen was in the sleeping room and said bad 
things about medical care to another person. I went to the window to report to 
the doctor. The doctor ignored me. I went to them again. They twisted my arm. I 
reported again. The doctor said it deserved it.<br>
<br>
There was a young man, like my brother Lu Jun, who played football and wore an 
army coat and sweatpants. We have a good relationship with each other. Even if 
we eat, there is only food in the mental hospital. He told me not to help.<br>
<br>
An old man said to me, &quot;Ge Yimin, you have a grandmother who likes you best.&quot; I 
don&#39;t know how he knew my grandmother was still alive. How could he say that my 
grandmother liked me the most. Once in the activity room, he suddenly said to 
me, &quot;look, Jinshan&quot;, pointed out the window, and soon said no.<br>
<br>
He also said that I was in pain when I made the electroacupuncture, but when 
others did it, I helped plug in the wiring board. He said that as long as we did 
not oppose the party and society.<br>
<br>
In a mental hospital, a cigarette can be an emperor. If you give someone a 
cigarette, he will kneel down and shout to you, &quot;long live my emperor!&quot;<br>
<br>
When I was wearing red pants, a nurse said, &quot;Ge Yimin, why are you wearing red 
pants?&quot; I said, &quot;what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; She said tie it up. I said tie it up. 
She asked Du Yu and others to tie me up. The male doctor who came to the ward to 
do ECG had to do it on my bound bed and said, &quot;don&#39;t argue with them.&quot; I said, 
&quot;thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
After tying it, Dr. Zhang Wei did it. I told her to do it gently. A little 
later, a young nurse Tang came to do it again and said, &quot;Ge Yimin, are you still 
young? My son is as tall as you.&quot; But at that time, my son only reached my 
knees. &quot;You are shameless and indecent,&quot; she added<br>
<br>
At lunch, a woman, dressed in casual clothes, red and black, was very beautiful. 
She looked like a Hong Kong star. She came to deliver dinner and said, &quot;why did 
he tie it?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VI<br>
<br>
I like singing in the mental hospital, especially in the excited state. 
Sometimes I sing international songs. I live on the fourth floor and often talk 
with female patients on the fifth floor. There is an ambulatory in the activity 
room and bathroom, but there is a gap in the middle. We can chat in front of 
each other. In the early morning of one day, a female patient on the sixth floor 
loudly sang the international song &quot;this is the last struggle. Unite and 
tomorrow, intina schunner will surely realize it&quot;. I said, &quot;good head of the 
sixth floor.&quot; Yaoxuerui on the fifth floor followed me and said, &quot;good head on 
the sixth floor.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the ward, I sang Andy Lau&#39;s &quot;Chinese people&quot; that &quot;there is still a dream in 
the future, and we will explore together&quot;. I sang &quot;there is still a dream in the 
future, and Lao Tzu will explore alone&quot;. A man like chow yun fat said this about 
me. I don&#39;t know whether he said that I have changed well or not. He was worried 
that it would be difficult to find a job after he was discharged from hospital. 
I suggested him to sell wine to wine merchants, go to supermarkets and wholesale 
departments, and ride a battery car instead of technology and culture.<br>
<br>
During the ward round, a patient also told the doctor how he was doing. The 
doctor said that if you can go to work, you can go to work. He said yes. It is 
true that mental patients should be able to support themselves after they are 
discharged from the hospital. Of course, now in Zhenjiang, we also provide 
subsidies for mental patients who have no income in January 7 or 800 to maintain 
their basic livelihood. This is what will be said later.<br>
<br>
There is an occupational therapy room in the mental hospital, which means that 
stable patients change their environment. I often go to the music room, wear 
headphones to listen to Teresa Teng&#39;s songs, and turn over the old pictorial. 
During work therapy, male and female patients are together. There are young male 
patients who try to chat up girls, which generally makes girls unhappy. Of 
course, I have seen a pair of young patients, like small objects, who are 
together and holding hands during work therapy.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the nurses upstairs also came to our ward and asked the male patients 
to help bind the female patients. Once the bound female patients said that the 
male patients took the opportunity to touch her and protested. Because the 
nurses asked them to help, the nurses did not investigate.<br>
<br>
Zhenjiang psychiatric hospital (No. 4 hospital) was originally built for the 
volunteer army. Some volunteers were stimulated on the battlefield and 
transferred to Zhenjiang for treatment. They were in a separate ward, wearing 
military uniforms. Once when I entered the hospital, I gave an old soldier half 
a pack of cigarettes. He was not tall, thin and capable. He called Huadong. He 
often came to our ward to play when he got up early in the morning.<br>
<br>
Once, when the volunteer army was in the hospital, I sang in front of the 
window: &quot;you are the red kid on the Long March, I am the younger generation of 
the revolutionary team.&quot; I gave them cigarettes. Two or three volunteers came, 
and I gave them cigarettes.<br>
<br>
An old doctor came to our ward to talk to a patient. The patient was holding a 
broom. I saw that the old doctor&#39;s job number was 001. Either the president or 
the Secretary dared to let the patient put down the broom.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I let a few patients kneel down and teach them slogans. When they were 
right, I said, &quot;Aiqing, keep fit&quot; and gave them a cigarette. If you shout wrong, 
&quot;Ge Yimin&quot; often says the opposite, saying that you shout wrong and have no 
smoke. An old man named Hu was right. When he took a cigarette, he laughed at 
others and said you were wrong.<br>
<br>
This time, Zhang Wei is my doctor in charge. Once she asked me to enter the 
doctor&#39;s office. I sat in front of her. She said, &quot;she wants you.&quot; she asked me 
to go to another female doctor. I didn&#39;t know her. I was puzzled.<br>
<br>
A female health worker talked about me and women and said that I would show a 
woman her graduation certificate. I don&#39;t remember telling her that after I 
showed her her her graduation certificate, she said, &quot;love you, love you.&quot; they 
laughed.<br>
<br>
After leaving the hospital that time, Zhang Wei summarized that &quot;the total 
period of illness was 18 years&quot;, but it was actually eight years. I was ill for 
90 years. At that time, I was only 29 years old in 1998. I don&#39;t understand.<br>
<br>
I was so excited that I didn&#39;t sleep well at night. The next day, in manager 
Cai&#39;s office, he asked me what time it was in the evening. I said I didn&#39;t turn 
on the TV, I didn&#39;t know the time, and I couldn&#39;t find the remote control. He 
immediately said, &quot;where is the remote control?&quot; Where is the person who 
controls me?.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VII<br>
<br>
At that time, I lived on the fourth floor. It was convenient for me to chat with 
the female patients on the fifth floor. The male patients on the third floor 
could not talk. I was sometimes jealous and poor. I often talk with yaoxuerui. 
Suddenly, she sticks out her head. She is very beautiful. I call her beauty. She 
is very happy and says her name is Xiaohong. The other day, yaoxuerui poked his 
head out of the side. It was very beautiful. I said it was more beautiful than 
Xiaohong. She said she was Xiaohong. Yaoxuerui said that Xiaohong bullied her, 
grabbed the TV and slapped her, telling me not to talk to Xiaohong. We changed 
directions, but she changed directions. I didn&#39;t listen. I still stood there and 
talked with Xiaohong, but yaoxuerui was more sincere.<br>
<br>
A firefighter named Li Man also participated in the chat with yaoxuerui. We say 
that snow auspicious year, and Yao says that snow auspicious year. Li Man&#39;s 
colleague often brings a lot of delicious food. I asked him to give you some to 
zhuoaiping. Zhuo is a tramp. He was brought in by the rescue station and took 
his medicine.<br>
<br>
Yaoxuerui asked me when I would be discharged from the hospital. I said 10 days, 
and then asked Li Man? I said that when I went home for the new year, Yao 
laughed and li man laughed. It was summer. Li Man has lived for one year. He is 
often called by doctors and nurses to do things, such as emptying the 
wastebasket. I say you are a j person, and they can&#39;t call you around.<br>
<br>
When I was admitted to the hospital for the second time, at night, I was tied to 
my bed. I couldn&#39;t move at all. I just looked at the fluorescent lamp on the 
roof. It was dazzling. Like Jesus, a health worker came in and asked, &quot;Ge Yimin, 
do you still know me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Working in Changzhou Benniu (Changzhou branch of provincial agricultural means 
of production), Zhao, who is doing color printing, chatted in my office. When I 
talked about my ideal society, she said, &quot;here you are again.&quot; I haven&#39;t talked 
to her before, nor told me that I was ill.<br>
<br>
In the hospital, I saw a girl walking in front of me, with other people 
following. It was quite revolutionary.<br>
<br>
On the way to the hospital with my mother, I met zhuguojing driving. Cai Guangyi 
was in the car and asked where to go. I said the old place. I told my mother 
that Zhu Guojing was my ZYJ Health Bureau, but followed Cai Guangyi. At the 
hospital, my mother told the doctor to take more medicine. The doctor suddenly 
said, &quot;take 100 pills.&quot; At the roadside of the hospital, I twisted my mother&#39;s 
ear. My mother asked why. I said &quot;hospital&quot; means that my ears are over.<br>
<br>
The nurse said that I said that the BP machine was my wife. I can&#39;t remember.<br>
<br>
A patient told me that President Clinton knew everything about me.<br>
<br>
Once the nurse asked me to brush the bed. I was not very good. A nurse said, &quot;Ge 
Yimin is very smart.&quot; Like my primary school classmate linrongping.<br>
<br>
A patient touched Dr. Zhang Wei&#39;s chest, and the result was &quot;one tie, two 
electroacupuncture, three slaps&quot;. Zhang immediately asked someone to tie him up, 
gave him a second electroacupuncture and hit him three times in the mouth.<br>
<br>
A young man came in, his food was taken away by others, and he didn&#39;t smoke. 
Every day I smoked, he and I picked up the train. It was I who took a smoke and 
gave him a smoke. He had hallucinations and auditory hallucinations. He said 
that the medical staff carried him on the stretcher. Someone said, &quot;it&#39;s him.&quot; 
he thought it was him. He thought he was a great man. This is a competition with 
the &quot;sage of crape myrtle&quot; bar friends who think they are the only sage of crape 
myrtle. They are about to go out of the mountain to be the emperor and marry Liu 
Yifei. They don&#39;t work and wait for the non-existent &quot;coming out of the 
mountain&quot; date every day. Year after year, they are all the hanging wires at the 
bottom of the society. They are all psychotic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VIII<br>
<br>
Psychosis has a kind of mania, I am this type, but &quot;since ancient times, there 
have been many talents with manic depression&quot;.<br>
<br>
There was a young patient named Zhang Aimin. During the SARS period, he was 
isolated in a small room. He sang in it early in the morning: &quot;the East is red, 
the sun is rising, and China has a Zhang Aimin.&quot; Sing confidently without 
blushing or being ashamed. He walked unsteadily and restlessly. A female health 
worker wanted to tie him. The nurse taolingwei said not to tie him. The health 
worker wanted to tie him. Taolingwei said, &quot;the health worker listens to the 
nurse.&quot; I said, &quot;you tell her to listen to you.&quot; Taolingwei said, &quot;she wouldn&#39;t 
listen, so she had to talk big about her. He couldn&#39;t walk steadily. If he was 
tied up, he couldn&#39;t hold his hand when he fell off.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was discharged from the hospital before he recovered from his illness. We 
were all surprised that he could not walk steadily. A little nurse said, &quot;not 
everyone can recover to 100%.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a patient named zhangzhongtang, who was older than me. He was a bit of 
a show. I teased him about the Secretary of the provincial Party committee, and 
told his wife so. His wife laughed and said that he was also the Secretary of 
the provincial Party committee. We conclude that we will also see a doctor, talk 
more manic, talk less depressive, talk less, talk a lot of schizophrenia, and 
then laugh.<br>
<br>
Once, shilianghua, a nurse, laughed loudly and repeated my:<br>
<br>

<br>
Looks like a mother from afar,<br>
<br>
It looks like a dog.<br>

It looks like a wall,<br>

It turned out to be a wall.<br>

<br>
When I was ill, my brother told me that Sanmao committed suicide. I still don&#39;t 
believe it. Later, I wrote &quot;commemorating Sanmao&quot; and wrote in Zhenjiang daily. 
Of course, the non mainstream works were not published in the newspaper.<br>
<br>
Nerves 22. Strangers in heaven -- Commemorating Sanmao<br>
<br>
In the yuan of 1992, when Mei Xue competed with Fang Fang, Ge Yimin said to a 
stranger in heaven that he had no choice but to sacrifice him. He said: &quot;I think 
Sanmao has been in the world since he was born. So far, it has been forty-nine 
years. I recall that Sanmao&#39;s quality is not enough to describe gold and jade, 
its nature is not enough to describe ice and snow as clean, its God is not 
enough to describe stars and moon as essence, and its appearance is not enough 
to describe its color.&quot;.<br>
<br>
500 years ago, he took an Indian man in gray,<br>
<br>
One year ago, I came to the ward of Taipei wing general hospital,<br>
<br>
Sanmao told him that he was very tired,<br>
<br>
The man in grey spread his white wings,<br>
<br>
Sanmao finally put down her Sahara,<br>
<br>
Started another journey,<br>
<br>
Strangers in this paradise,<br>
<br>
And sat at the right hand of the Lord,<br>
<br>
She was surprised to find that,<br>
<br>
I have pursued the Sahara all my life,<br>
<br>
But appeared in the kingdom of heaven of the Lord.<br>
<br>
But Sanmao is still repeating people&#39;s last words,<br>
<br>
So another Sanmao was repeating another Sahara to the people,<br>
<br>
He must also be a stranger in heaven,<br>
<br>
Because the planet has no place.<br>
<br>
When I was just admitted to the hospital, I brought a bag of salted chicken. A 
fat old man asked me for two pieces. When he finished eating, he still wanted 
them. As soon as I was kind, I said, &quot;let&#39;s take you together,&quot; and gave them to 
him together. He immediately went to the toilet to eat, and several people 
followed him. Later, he still asked me for something. I said, &quot;what&#39;s the use of 
giving you a bag of salted chicken?&quot; A male hygienist said, &quot;it&#39;s no use giving 
him a pig.&quot; The old man also eats the leftover porridge of others. He is also a 
poor man.<br>
<br>
The next morning when I entered the hospital, there was no smoke. A group of 
people were smoking in the washroom. I went there. Someone asked me to ask a 
30-year-old man for cigarettes and said he would give them to me. His name was 
Zhang Jun. he gave them to me and soon gave me another one. The patient said he 
claimed to have seen hjt.<br>
<br>
Once I talked about communism to patients and female health workers and said, 
&quot;Zhang Jun said he had seen hjt.&quot; When Zhang Jun came back, I immediately said 
to Zhang Jun, &quot;who doesn&#39;t want to realize communism? Hjt also wants to.&quot;<br>
<br>
2011 fast girl, like Liu Xin, she loves to sing &quot;old boy&quot;, I love to sing in the 
ward: &quot;that&#39;s the person I miss day and night.&quot; Once my wife came to deliver 
food. When I saw it, I immediately sang it to her. The health worker said it was 
the right person this time. My wife laughed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IX<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, the cigarettes in mental hospitals were not so tense. Patients 
could put a whole pack of cigarettes and lighters on their bodies. When I 
smoked, a young man stood beside me waiting for cigarettes. I always left a long 
cigarette end for him. Somehow, I got nervous later (the lighter was collected 
because other psychiatric hospitals lost fire, and our ward also opened another 
north door, which is usually locked.) The cigarettes are kept by the nurse, 6 
cigarettes a day, and the nurse or health worker is also required for ignition. 
At this time, there are so many people waiting for cigarettes that I have to 
arrange to give a long cigarette end to one person in the corridor, let him 
smoke two cigarettes, give it to the next one, and then explain it to the next 
person. A long cigarette end requires two or three people to smoke together, and 
one person has two cigarettes. Because they know that I give cigarette butts. As 
soon as I smoke, several people surround me. Some people are addicted. They 
smoke two more. I say I won&#39;t take you next time.<br>
<br>
When I took my son to the gate of the Construction Committee to play ball games 
(marbles) during my weekend at work, the nurse saw it and told me when I was 
hospitalized.<br>
<br>
When I was in hospital for the first time, the doctor liguohai asked me about my 
similarities and differences, and I told him. Tianzhihong, the director, said 
that the state has wasted training my college students. Later, before I was 
hospitalized, a doctor asked me, can I be the provincial Secretary of W? I said 
yes. Ask again, can you make money? I said no, I also said I felt good.<br>
<br>
Sometimes patients do not cooperate and will attack the medical staff. 
Taolingwei said that it is a routine, and nurses and health workers will 
retaliate. For example, when the patient is tied to the bed, huqimei hit the 
patient in the mouth, especially the male health worker. There was a strong man 
about 50 years old who spit at Liu, the male hygienist who tied him up. After he 
tied him up, Liu hit him in the mouth. Then the nurse came for 
electroacupuncture, but he didn&#39;t respond at all. Usually, the patient was very 
painful. He had to bite his teeth and make pain or beg for mercy. His face was 
expressionless, so the nurse was afraid to do it.<br>
<br>
There was a patient, a young man, whose family came to see him. I heard his 
family say, &quot;I want to eat fried rice with eggs. Won&#39;t you tell me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Another patient, a middle-aged man, once asked his uncle to stir fry rice in 
oil. His uncle put eggs. He was very satisfied and told his sick friend that he 
also put eggs.<br>
<br>
I was a model worker in the hospital. Once the health worker asked me to brush 
the toilet wall tiles. A nurse saw it and said, &quot;where else does Ge Yimin do 
this?&quot; The health worker said, &quot;why can&#39;t Ge Yimin do it?&quot; Another nurse said to 
me, &quot;Ge Yimin wants to do everything, but he can&#39;t do it well.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a young man who often played with me. I told him: &quot;houdejian&#39;s shrimp 
Chenglin was stabbed away by 52kx. Houdejian was so angry that I laughed to 
death.&quot; every time we talked, we laughed.<br>
<br>
I heard from my mother that once in my hometown, I was excited to go to the 
pond. Su fan, a distant relative, said, &quot;I want to be a citizen.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have seen the Korean drama I am a legend and like Quan Xueji. I played Quan 
Xueji in the hospital. I found Li huazi, Jiang xiuren and liangyalin among the 
patients to form a Madonna band. A young man, I ordered fried rice and duck 
blood Vermicelli Soup for him. He was anonymous. I made him a water cup, a drink 
bottle, and asked a male nurse to write his name. He didn&#39;t know his name. I 
said I knew. I took a pen and wrote &quot;plum blossom&quot;. The nurse said beggar.<br>
<br>
When I was ill, I was always inexplicably excited. At the beginning of several 
nights, I always ran to the street to sing and walk aimlessly. I thought I was a 
great person, and it was also a declaration.<br>
<br>
Once my brother took me to the hospital. On the way, I walked ahead. I said I 
took the initiative to go. The doctor looked at me well and said that I would 
not be hospitalized. I said that the Chinese were small. When he was old and 
shrunk up, he was hospitalized.<br>
<br>
Once, I took my mother to the ward and said that I was hospitalized. The doctor 
also said that I was OK. I said that I was rich and asked my mother to take out 
her pocket money to see him. This has the element of acting. I am also an actor.<br>
<br>
Once, when a ZYJ died, Dr. Tao asked me to carry the body to the funeral 
carriage until I got on the road.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter X<br>
<br>
Once, when I was hospitalized, several old men specially told me that Tang Bohu 
had nine beauties. I said nine younger sisters. They said that they had nine 
wives. But my classmates in the &quot;age of innocence&quot; and &quot;his women&quot; had more than 
nine women.<br>
<br>
When my mother and my sister-in-law sent me to the hospital, I sang at the door 
of the hospital, &quot;I have a little secret hidden in my heart. I want to tell you 
that it is not a general feeling and meaning, it is my heart.&quot; I didn&#39;t refuse 
to be hospitalized. On the contrary, I was a little happy. I gave East China 
half a pack of cigarettes. In the hospital, I asked my sister-in-law to give me 
more cigarettes. She gave more cigarettes to the nurse. I said, &quot;are you my 
sister-in-law or her sister-in-law?&quot;<br>
<br>
Inside, there was a patient a, in his 30s, who was tied up and spoke very hard. 
I gave him the lunch my mother bought me. There was a big ribs.<br>
<br>
When I was inside, I still said that g was a small JB, and a said to me, &quot;you 
are a big JB.&quot;<br>
<br>
A patient B, in his 40s, brought nectarines and drinks at home. He told me that 
it was my fellow Jurong Dazhuo who was giving his drinks to A. I asked B to 
bring them to me. A heard that and dared to drink two mouthfuls before giving 
them to us.<br>
<br>
At that time, I suspected that Zhanghua, the old manager of the unit I met in 
Yangzhou, was y. he said he had seen y in the hospital. A fat male nurse C said 
he had seen y in the welcome ceremony in primary school.<br>
<br>
C said, &quot;why didn&#39;t Ge Yimin believe in Buddhism?&quot;, They know I believe in 
Christianity, so I say Christianity is in line with my thinking.<br>
<br>
When I was sitting in the activity room that time, Dr. Zhang Wei suddenly came 
over and said, &quot;Ge Yimin, you said it was you who came down.&quot; I didn&#39;t say it 
before. I just said it was class J. I wasn&#39;t old enough before.<br>
<br>
On that winter evening, my brother took me to the hospital, and Zhang was 
sitting alone. My brother seemed to know her very well, just like a relative. 
The scald care written on the small blackboard reminds me that my son has 
scalded his chest with boiling water, but it is unreasonable to write about 
scald care in winter.<br>
<br>
One morning, Zhang Wei asked me to give a speech to a group of medical students. 
In the small activity room, there were about 30 students. I just went in and 
said I was nervous. A boy said don&#39;t be nervous. When I saw a beautiful girl in 
front of me, tall and smiling, I said, &quot;this girl is really beautiful.&quot; they 
laughed. I will talk about my communism. Thieves and beggars are communists. 
Because you have them or not, they steal you, beg you, and share your property. 
I told him that before I was hospitalized, I liked to give cigarettes and money 
to the beggars&#39; sect in the street. The boy asked, &quot;who is the sect leader?&quot; I 
said I didn&#39;t know. He said, &quot;it&#39;s you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I say that today&#39;s productive forces have achieved communism, and that one 
person in agriculture can feed a hundred people is the content of nerves.<br>
<br>
I like to sing in front of the bathroom window in the activity room. Once, 
people nearby said that someone had been watching you in the opposite building.<br>
<br>
There are always beautiful women walking along the road, or doctors and nurses 
walking. When I see them, I always say, &quot;this woman is really beautiful. She is 
from Hong Kong.&quot; Once I saw several people passing by. I just said, &quot;this woman 
is so beautiful.&quot; The male doctor of the same trade immediately said, &quot;I see. 
I&#39;m from Hong Kong.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was during my Weibo certification that I chatted with taolingwei. Tao said, 
&quot;Ge Yimin, you are famous, and the world knows you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XI<br>
<br>
Nurse jiajianqing and I were in the small activity room. A nurse named 
jiangbiyun came in. She was very beautiful. Her face was smart, especially her 
eyes. She looked more beautiful in her nurse clothes. She asked nurse Jia that 
her son was three or four years old and wanted him to learn how to ride a horse. 
She asked where Zhenjiang could learn how to ride a horse? They both meant to 
let the children exercise. I broke in and said that there was a road to Xuefu. 
Jiang Biyun ignored me and left.<br>
<br>
After a while, jiangbiyun came in again. She said, &quot;I want to understand. I 
don&#39;t ride a horse. I ride a dog.&quot; But my last name is Ge:) I call her Shu Qi, 
which is true.<br>
<br>
Still in the small activity room, nurse Jia likes to let me hear &quot;ow ow...&quot; in 
the rescue room When I looked in the window, it was the patient&#39;s mute hand 
holding nurse Jia&#39;s throat. Nurse Jia lay down on the bed. The mute pressed her 
body and plotted against the rules. The door was closed. I kicked the door open, 
stuck the mute&#39;s neck with my left arm, and took it away from the wall. Then 
everyone else came in. The hero saved the beauty. Nurse Jia said it was a dumb 
premeditation. She closed the door and fell on her. Afterwards, nurse Jia 
brought me a lot of good cigarettes at home, as well as to others, including the 
patient &quot;liyuanba&quot; and the security guard. I gave my cigarettes to &quot;peiyuanqing&quot; 
and Zhang Liang.<br>
<br>
There was monitoring. Jiang Biyun saw it. When he met me, he said to me, &quot;hero&quot;. 
Before I could react, I immediately said, &quot;you are a hero.&quot; He changed his name 
to &quot;beauty.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this time, I was in hospital for a few days. I had a sleeping injection at 
night. I saw that jiangbiyun came to give me an injection. I was very happy. I 
took off my pants and said, &quot;do it myself?&quot; She said, &quot;in person.&quot; I said, &quot;so 
grand?&quot; &quot;Grand,&quot; she said Somehow, she didn&#39;t hurt at all. She said, &quot;OK.&quot;.<br>
<br>
There is also a new nurse named zhanghaiyan. She is also very beautiful. She is 
older than jiangbiyun. She knows that my name is jiangbiyun as Shuqi. One night, 
she said to me, &quot;let Shuqi play against you.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few days later, in the big activity room, Jiang Biyun sat at the door. I went 
up and took her by the hand. I pulled her up. I said, &quot;let Miss Shuqi act for 
you.&quot; She struggled.<br>
<br>
Jiangbiyun said in the big activity room, &quot;Ge Yimin has been here for so many 
days. Why hasn&#39;t he recovered?&quot; That is to say, I was a little excited, so I 
took care to restrain myself. She really cared about me, and I would like to 
thank her.<br>
<br>
At noon one day, jiangbiyun was on duty in the small activity room. There was a 
patient I called &quot;Western poison&quot;, &quot;Western Christ&quot; (called &quot;mute Oriental 
Christ&quot;, Yang Lin), also known as &quot;wuyunzhao&quot;, who was tied up all the time. He 
was tied up from the time I was hospitalized to the time I was discharged, and 
he tied it voluntarily. The guards acted as a bomb and said he would hit people. 
The door of the small ward where he lives has also been locked. There is also a 
young man &quot;Luo Cheng&quot; who has been tied up. The ward is dedicated to the people 
who are tied up. They tie their hands and untie their hands when eating.<br>
<br>
Wuyunzhao wanted to have a bowel movement and called him &quot;Xiao Jiang&quot;. Jiang 
Biyun said &quot;um&quot; and ignored him. Wuyunzhao has always been called &quot;Xiao Jiang&quot; 
and &quot;it&#39;s too late&quot;. I said to jiangbiyun, &quot;just open the door and leave the 
rest to me.&quot; Jiangbiyun was still &quot;uh huh&quot;. When she was in a hurry, she said, 
&quot;wait a minute&quot; and &quot;come right away&quot;, but she didn&#39;t open the door for more 
than 20 minutes until she got off work and jiajianqing came to work.<br>
<br>
Jiajianqing opened the door. I took a bedpan and a large stack of straw paper 
(my personal) and went in to collect the stool for Wu Yunzhao. He still tied his 
hands. I took off his pants. He came out immediately. There were a lot of 
bedpans. The bedpan was full, and the excrement touched his butt. I changed 
another bedpan, but there were still a lot. When I wiped it for him, I used a 
lot of straw paper, there were dozens of pieces, because the butt was full of 
excrement.<br>
<br>
The security guard (specially guarding a young man who was seriously injured 
outside to prevent him from committing suicide, and the two security guards took 
turns on the day shift and night shift) also watched and said to the nurse, 
&quot;it&#39;s like a hill.&quot; he said, &quot;don&#39;t say it. It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Afterwards, old nurse Zhu brought me some food, such as biscuits. I didn&#39;t ask 
for them. I said, &quot;I did it myself. I don&#39;t do it for five cents.&quot; She said, 
&quot;what is self-help five?&quot; I said to do good deeds voluntarily without 
compensation. &quot;Liyuanba&quot; came in and ate.<br>
<br>
Last time, it was the &quot;little beauty&quot; nurse. She began not to give me access to 
the small activity room. There was a patient&#39;s stool in the small ward. It was 
on the bed sheet. I went in with a patient a, and a male nurse was also present. 
A helped the patient get up. I went around the bed sheet to the small toilet for 
cleaning. First, I used a toilet brush to clean the stool at the water inlet and 
outlet, washed it away, and then brushed the bed sheet. When it was slightly 
clean, I rolled the bed sheet and took it out for machine washing. What&#39;s a 
little strange is that the patient&#39;s buttocks and trousers are free of shit. 
They are all on the sheets.<br>
<br>
Last time, one night, I woke up and suddenly saw a small toilet, full of shit, 
the whole floor, but no straw paper. I went to the top of the corridor, found 
the &quot;Faye Wong&quot; health worker, told her that I wanted to clean and needed a mop. 
She opened the door to the big bathroom, and I took a mop, broom and dung 
dustpan.<br>
<br>
I first swept the fecal dustpan again and again, poured it into the water outlet 
and washed it off, then poured water into the washbasin to wash it off again and 
again, and finally cleaned it up again and again with a mop. It took a lot of 
effort, but all the flushing toilets in the small toilet were full of shit. I 
suspect they were deliberately placed to let me do this good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 12<br>
<br>
This time, I arranged the number of heroes in the hospital and named myself the 
second hero Yuwen Chengdu.<br>
<br>
Feng Bianzheng was left as the first hero, Li Yuanba, and let him rush ahead. 
Last time he stayed in the VIP room, he was close to me and called each other 
&quot;Huazai&quot;. He brought a lot of cigarettes, Yuxi and Zhonghua. The whole line was 
put in the cabinet of the VIP room and gave me a lot of gifts. Her family also 
exchanged things. Her wife had lived in the VIP room and her sister had come. I 
was familiar with them. Once I said to her sister and brother-in-law, &quot;I 
defeated Ma Yingjiu&#39;s threemillion troops alone.&quot; Liyuanba broke in, and I 
immediately said, &quot;I won the war.&quot; Her sister and brother-in-law laughed.<br>
<br>
Liyuanba also asked me to sing to his son. I would sing Andy Lau&#39;s &quot;love 
forgetting water&quot;.<br>
<br>
Liyuanba is a policeman who likes to fight. He was wearing leather shoes and 
wearing a belt. My brother came to see me and felt strange. He said it was for 
me. Someone was unfriendly to me. I stood by the bed and said I couldn&#39;t stand 
there. I stopped myself with my body. I told liyuanba that he would scold the 
man and beat him. Later, the man was tied to the bed. Liyuanba turned off the 
light (with monitoring) and hit him in the face with the man&#39;s shoes. I also hit 
him. It was very cathartic. At the end of my speech, I said that it was bad for 
me to beat people. When I said about beating them, Zhang said, &quot;he didn&#39;t tell 
me.&quot; Then grab me by the collar and let me out. Nurses like to ask liyuanba to 
tie people up and give them something to eat. I also like to help tie people up.<br>
<br>
Zhang Liang was named the third hero peiyuanqing. Peiyuanqing was like an 
athlete. I gave him cigarettes when I thought of my brother road army in the 
University. Peiyuanqing looks completely normal. He came in after hurting 
others.<br>
<br>
Here we talk about the so-called non sentencing of crimes committed by mental 
patients. In fact, there is no difference between a mental patient&#39;s crime and a 
normal person&#39;s sentence, except that one is serving a sentence in prison and 
the other is being held in a mental hospital for treatment. For example, 
peiyuanqing injured a person. The court ruled that he should be held in a mental 
hospital for treatment for two years. The two security guards seriously injured 
a person, which is the same as the court ruled that he should be held in a 
mental hospital for treatment. According to the court&#39;s judgment on the merits 
of the case, the normal person is sentenced to 2 years&#39; imprisonment, and the 
mental patient is detained for treatment for 2 years. That young man is thin, 
weak and insignificant, but he committed adultery and hurt his husband. His 
father came to see him every day and brought him food. He also said that he 
would guarantee one fruit a day. Because of the epidemic, he talked downstairs. 
We were on the second floor.<br>
<br>
Peiyuanqing also claimed to be the greatest philosopher, surpassing Nietzsche, 
which startled me. We have a room. The young man who was seriously injured is 
also in this room. The security guard sleeps beside the couch bed. When I am in 
a bad mood, I feel depressed and disgusted. You are more confident when you are 
in a good mood.<br>
<br>
Peiyuanqing claimed that Trump&#39;s daughter was his wife. A first-rate star cried, 
made trouble and hanged him. It was Deng Ziqi. Because he had a western special 
wife, Deng Ziqi couldn&#39;t be his wife, so he made trouble:)<br>
<br>
Yang kuohai, a young man in Wuhan, was named the fourth hero. He had relatives 
working in Danyang, Zhenjiang, and came from Wuhan alone. His father was scared 
to send him in because he was suicidal and had taken drugs. When I first met 
him, I slept and found him tied up and wearing a mask. He looked like a doctor. 
When I tied him up, I was asleep. Later, I heard that he covered his hand with a 
towel. The nurse was afraid of his resistance and sprayed alcohol. Liyuanba also 
slapped him.<br>
<br>
Because my friend Zixi Shengkai is from Wuhan, and my girlfriend Li Min is from 
Wuhan, I am kind to him, and I don&#39;t dislike the Wuhan epidemic. He was sprayed 
with alcohol, so I gave him water to wash, but his blue towel was full of 
alcohol, so I washed his face with my yellow towel. I also told the nurse that 
it was discolored, and soaked his blue towel in his face.<br>
<br>
The next afternoon, peiyuanqing gave me a dry noodles mix. I asked xiongkuohai, 
&quot;is it Wuhan hot and dry noodles?&quot; He said, &quot;elephant.&quot; I didn&#39;t order noodles. 
Peiyuanqing forced me to eat them. Nurse Zhu said, &quot;I ordered them. You can eat 
them.&quot; I ate it. It was very delicious.<br>
<br>
When Xiong Kuo Hai and I were alone in the small bathroom, I sang: 
&quot;xiaoyixiaoerlang, carrying the schoolbag to school, is not afraid of the sun, 
nor the wind and rain.&quot; He said his grandfather taught him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XIII<br>
<br>
Wu Yunzhao was named the fifth hero because he was a big man. He was also named 
the Western Christ, opposite to the mute Eastern Christ, and his beds were just 
in the east-west direction. Wuyunzhao and Luo Cheng are always tied to the bed, 
so they need someone to pick up urine and urine. I like doing this dirty work. I 
once said to Jia Jianqing, &quot;because Jesus serves people like this.&quot; He once said 
to Jia Jianqing, &quot;I don&#39;t care what I think of GC, but I admire the Red Army.&quot;, 
He even claimed to be the &quot;Last Red Army&quot; on the Internet and loved to sing &quot;ten 
free Red Army&quot;. Another anonymous did the dirty work. He did it before I came 
here. Now he and I are rushing to do the dirty work.<br>
<br>
Wuyunzhao said he would work for him. He had a big cigarette. I said, &quot;your wife 
comes and brings me something.&quot; He said, &quot;no wife.&quot; Zhangmuliang, an old 
patient, once said to me, &quot;most people here have no wife, and most of them have 
a wife and divorce.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young man who is always tied up is Luo Cheng, the seventh hero. Luo Cheng is 
also tied up all day. He is voluntary. Saying not to tie up is also harmful. He 
lies in bed all day long except for eating. He restricts freedom again and 
again. There is no freedom at all. The only happy thing is to get a snack to eat 
when giving out snacks. Luo Cheng told me that Yuwen Chengdu was a big lecher.<br>
<br>
The mute Yang was named the eighth hero Yang Lin, and the eastern Christ. At 
first, he was locked up in the East rescue room (the borrower). He had a fever. 
He took his temperature all day. Later, his temperature was normal and he was 
released.<br>
<br>
When I smoke, I sometimes leave cigarette butts for anonymous. Anonymous also 
gives me cigarettes when they do things. After dinner, we put on TV in the small 
activity room. At first, we often put on model programs and Internet TV. We can 
choose to go to these stations.<br>
<br>
The ward director&#39;s name is quhongfang, an old doctor. Last time I was a hero to 
save the United States, she also praised me and said, &quot;that&#39;s how to protect the 
medical staff.&quot; She later said to me, &quot;get better. I&#39;m sorry, Jia.&quot; I also 
talked to jiajianqing later.<br>
<br>
Jia Jianqing presided over the morning meetings of the medical staff. Director 
Qu stood and listened. I said this to health worker B. she said, &quot;you will know 
if it takes a long time.&quot; I remembered that nurse Jia had to be the dean.<br>
<br>
Because the current binding device uses a small round iron pole switch like a 
magnet. Like a key, I think the round iron is a nuclear button. Now the 
psychiatric hospital basically does not do electroacupuncture, and electric 
shock is rare, that is, binding. One day, the column was placed on the table in 
the small activity room. I was the only one. I put the round iron in my pants 
pocket and patted the pocket, which was equivalent to controlling the hospital.<br>
<br>
There is a nurse named Liulu, Pangpang. One night, when I woke up, she showed me 
the watch list, which was about the patient&#39;s sleep. It was all red forks 
(representing sleep). It said Ge Yimin had less sleep. After I read it, Liu Lu 
picked up her pen and carried it off. I was a little excited. I took my pen and 
wrote on the back of the watch list. Liu Lu said, &quot;write less.&quot; I wrote a few 
words about the realization of communism.<br>
<br>
The next morning, nurse a, who was not tall and beautiful, looked like my 
classmate zhengrenxiang, so I once asked her for a latte. I went to the small 
activity room and asked me, &quot;who are you? Why are you scribbling on the duty 
list?&quot; I said, &quot;the dean&#39;s husband.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are two nurses: Xuxin and Zhouqian. Because their names, one last name and 
one first name, are &quot;Xuqian&quot;, I said it. One day after the morning meeting, in 
the big activity room, Jia Jianqing said to several nurses, &quot;he said that Xu Xin 
and Zhou Qian are Xu Qian.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Jia Jianqing was Xu Qian, I asked her, &quot;is that Xu Qian?&quot; She said, &quot;I&#39;m 
not as beautiful as Xu Qian.&quot; Another woman is more like Xu Qian. Her name is 
Zhang Jing. She is from a yard of our unit and rents our factory. Because of her 
work, she has been in contact with her for many times. She is the same as Xu 
Qian. Her face is like in a picture (the sentence of nerves). Old Wu of the unit 
introduced it to me jokingly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 14<br>
<br>
Xu Xin is very beautiful and beautiful. I call her number one. One day at the 
nurse station, I said to her outside, &quot;Mei Mei No. 1&quot;. She told me about her 
nurses. I said they were not as good-looking as you. She said, &quot;where is Rodin?&quot; 
Rodin didn&#39;t look good. I immediately said, &quot;ugly B bomb.&quot; Xuhe and the people 
present laughed. Yang, a health worker, said that I was always rude to her. I 
think so.<br>
<br>
Meimei No. 1 is the language my son used to play the glass ball at that time. It 
refers to the real ball closest to him, because it is best to play. For girls, 
it means not the most beautiful girl, but the nearest one.<br>
<br>
One night, I performed &quot;true and false king&quot; in the ward. This is the French 
film &quot;iron faced man&quot;. Because the king is bad, he was carefully planned. The 
real king was locked up on an island. The people who shut him up called him 
crazy and would say he was the king. So he said he was the king. The guards 
didn&#39;t believe it. A man with similar looks (his brother) changed his position 
and acted as the king. I said I was the real king and was locked up here, and... 
Because I have been telling Xu Xin in the corridor outside the nurse station 
that Xu Xin saw that I didn&#39;t mean to stop and asked someone to tie me up. I 
said, &quot;tie me up, you Xu Xin alone is enough.&quot; The next morning, jiajianqing 
came to work and untied me.<br>
<br>
It was still early. I was hospitalized for only 13 days. I asked my wife to 
forcibly pick me up, bought a coward cigarette and went to the hospital to 
distribute it. At that time, the health worker Faye Wong was sweeping the floor 
at the door. I stood in front of the window and asked people inside to take 
cigarettes. A good friend took a bag and a Christian zhangyoulong took a bag. 
They crowded together behind me. I was finished. But I was still excited and was 
hospitalized. A nurse asked me, &quot;why did Ge Yimin come in again?&quot; I said, &quot;it&#39;s 
dramatic.&quot; She just laughed. When I went in to get the cigarettes back, those 
people refused to admit it. Only zhangyoulong gave them back to me. Another 
person gave me the lighter and said it was mine.<br>
<br>
At that time, we still went to a bathroom to take a bath. Everyone lined up and 
the medical guards guarded each other at a distance. While waiting in line at 
the bathroom door, I said to director yaohongxiu, &quot;this is not an intoxicating 
smile. This is an intoxicating smile.&quot; I bent over with a smile and squatted 
down with a smile. At last, there was no sound, only shaking. It was the same as 
acting. At that time, a popular song &quot;Chinese folk songs&quot; was &quot;do you have an 
intoxicating smile? Wild geese flew over the chrysanthemums and filled their 
heads.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, my brother and my son sent me to the hospital. I felt the same as usual 
in the car. At the nurse station, we said to be hospitalized. The nurse asked, 
&quot;who of you is hospitalized?&quot; I said, &quot;I.&quot; The nurse couldn&#39;t see that I was 
abnormal. When I entered the small activity room, two people (tall and strong) 
surrounded me. I smoked and said, &quot;I&#39;m nervous.&quot; They said, &quot;don&#39;t be nervous.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a child inside who said she was a beautiful girl (nurse) every day. 
Later, I saw her. She was really beautiful. I looked at her through the window 
of the small activity room. She closed the window and pressed my hand. I didn&#39;t 
take it out. She said, &quot;I&#39;m trying hard.&quot; she slowly exerted the force, so I had 
to loosen it. When I was discharged from the hospital, she cared about me again 
and said, &quot;I won&#39;t say hello to you after leaving the hospital.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are two nurses, the older one is nurse Hu (I think of my sister-in-law, 
surnamed Hu), and the younger one is Zhang Qian (just as my sister-in-law&#39;s 
daughter is called Zhang Qian), as my wife Fang (main room). Jiajianqing and the 
little beauty stood at the door together, and I was their mother and daughter. I 
also thought about the fight between the two rooms. Although it was an outside 
room, I knew I liked jiajianqing (Xuqian).<br>
<br>
Watching TV in the big activity room, I saw the MV subtitle &quot;the story of 
running water taking time has changed three people&quot;, but this song only &quot;changed 
one person / two people / us&quot;. I was surprised and wondered whether the three 
people &quot;Ge Yimin, Xu Qian, Han Qinfen?&quot;<br>
<br>
On the blackboard of the large activity room, it was written: Chiang Kai Shek 
thought that there were many Chinese people, so it was difficult to do it, while 
Mao thought that many Chinese people were building strength. There were many 
revolutionary quotations and poems written on the wall of the ward corridor. I 
read them one by one. They were basically handwritten. The handwriting was 
different, and the pens used were different. The words were large and small. 
They were basically the sentences left by the early martyrs of the Communist 
Party of China. They were not afraid of sacrifice for the realization of 
communism. For example, in Ye Ting&#39;s poem &quot;climb out of the dog hole&quot;, a voice 
shouted: &quot;climb out and give you freedom! I long for freedom, but I deeply know 
- how can a human body climb out of the dog hole!&quot; I doubt the education and 
information I received. The content on the wall is similar to my primary school 
education (before 1980).<br>
<br>
When I talked about the Internationale in the hospital, I had to realize it. A 
patient asked me, &quot;it means French, internationalism, not communism.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once a hospital nurse hung a red badge of &quot;serving the people&quot;. There was a new 
nurse who didn&#39;t have one. I said, &quot;don&#39;t you want to serve the people?&quot; &quot;I 
think,&quot; she said<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XV<br>
<br>
In the hospital, the security guard told me that I sang well and pestered me to 
sing every day. When excited, they sometimes sing loudly while walking in the 
street, and sometimes they deliberately make the loudest sound, that is, acting. 
Must sing track: Cheng Lin&#39;s panda Mimi: &quot;the sun comes out, hey, illuminate me 
and illuminate you. We breathe the same air. This world, I live with you. Please 
let me help you, just like helping myself. Please let me care about you, just 
like caring about ourselves. This world will become more beautiful.&quot; It is in 
line with my great harmony world thought.<br>
<br>
The netizen Huahan Longxing once left a message in the post bar, saying that he 
found the man (the sage of crape myrtle, that is, me) and asked me if I had 
sung.<br>
<br>
Once in the hospital, he said to Jia Jianqing, &quot;where can I find such a good 
person (finger me), who is worthy of Xu Qian&#39;s clear youth.&quot; (chenmingzhen&#39;s 
where to find such a good person)<br>
<br>
There was a child who was hospitalized because he kept beating people 
involuntarily. He was locked in his room and beat people when he came out. Nurse 
Zhu asked me to take a bath for him. When I stood in front of the door, he hit 
me on the head, but it was different from the usual one. My head was like an 
iron bucket, and Weng&#39;s voice slowly died down. It was a bit like an electric 
needle, but it didn&#39;t hurt. It felt very comfortable. I don&#39;t know how the 
effect of being hit on the head at that time. Zhu said he thought I would fight 
back, but of course I wouldn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
I often think these two names are too similar: huqimei vs hexianmei. Hexianmei, 
my high school classmate, has always cared about me. Hu and he are similar. Why 
do they mean &quot;Hu does not return&quot; vs &quot;why does not return&quot;. Both Kai and Xian 
mean &quot;first&quot;. Huqimei is now the director of the nursing department. When she 
came to the ward round, I half knelt down to her and said, &quot;Xiaosheng Yuwen is 
polite in Chengdu.&quot; It&#39;s funny. She doesn&#39;t know about teacher sunzhaopin. It&#39;s 
a pity. We estimate that teacher sun is 80 years old.<br>
<br>
One night, when I woke up, I thought of the red XX on the sleep sheet recorded 
by the nurse (representing sleep), I thought of the word &quot;Climbing&quot;, and I 
thought of LinBiao (I saw the slogan on the wall when I was young that &quot;nothing 
is difficult in the world, as long as you are willing to climb&quot;, and remembering 
the word &quot;Climbing&quot; is linxx&#39;s big hand), so I sang &quot;I am LinBiao, beautiful 
LinBiao, I am LinBiao, strange LinBiao, I am LinBiao, Mao Zedong, you don&#39;t 
understand LinBiao.&quot; (I&#39;m a girl by xuhuaiyu) because they used both hands to 
draw the word &quot;pan&quot; in front of Luo Dan and Liu Lu, they were afraid. They asked 
someone to tie me to wuyunzhao. Wuyunzhao was also afraid of me and shouted. The 
health worker said, &quot;he tied his hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next morning, I had to relieve myself. The nurse relieved me of one hand. 
Anonymous took the bedpan. I squatted down. Wuyunzhao hit me on the head. Jiang 
Biyun came and asked me if I had any medical advice? Rodin said no, but the 
doctor didn&#39;t arrange &quot;protection&quot;. Jiang relieved me. I went to the bathroom.<br>
<br>
In the early days, I was discharged from the hospital after living for only 18 
days. It usually took more than a month. That time, it was Dr. Wei. Once I went 
in, I would wash the dishes. Originally, they arranged shifts. Dr. Wei and I 
agreed to leave the hospital. When my mother came, the head nurse had gone 
through all the formalities. My mother said I was playing magic inside.<br>
<br>
At that time, someone fell down when walking. He was unconscious. Like the new 
crown now, he broke his face. I don&#39;t know what disease he had. It was really 
painful. At the beginning, no one played with me. I was alone and lost. I took 
the initiative to take one person&#39;s arm. People need to socialize. No matter 
where they are, it&#39;s terrible to think about the single cell. Now the Internet 
is also social.<br>
<br>
I was a model worker in the hospital. For example, I received urine for people. 
I loved doing this dirty thing. I was better than Jesus to serve people. The 
discharge procedures were completed. When I was leaving, I still received urine. 
Even a nurse said, &quot;Ge Yimin has left, and no one has helped me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 16<br>
<br>
I called myself the president of the United Nations in the mental hospital. The 
nurse immediately asked, &quot;where is Annan?&quot; I said, &quot;Annan is my secretary 
general.&quot; It seems to make sense. Because I often say that doctors and nurses 
know.<br>
<br>
Later, I changed my name to world president. Director yaohongxiu said, &quot;isn&#39;t it 
the president of the United Nations?&quot; I said, &quot;the United Nations does not 
include all countries.&quot; Yaohongxiu smiled and said, &quot;you want all countries.&quot;<br>
<br>
A male health worker saw that I hadn&#39;t sent him a meal and said, &quot;the president 
of the world hasn&#39;t eaten yet.&quot; When my doctor came to the activity room that 
time, he first called me &quot;chairman&quot;. I told her that Deng and Bush were great, 
but when she acted for me (64, 9 / 11), she let me know myself.<br>
<br>
On the home page of my official website (Shenwang), I played the song &quot;on the 
Jinshan mountain in Zhenjiang&quot; for a while. Chairman Ge was in the song. Once a 
policeman Chen Jun called, and I answered. He joked &quot;chairman&quot;. That time, he 
asked me to turn off the song on the home page. Several policemen went to my 
house. I was at work. My wife was at home. She turned on the computer and 
watched Shenwang. A policeman said that the website would cost dozens of dollars 
in a month. My wife told them that I could not do it. That was my life.<br>
<br>
Chen Jun once came to my house to browse shenwang.com and said, &quot;Ge Yimin and Li 
Hongzi&quot;, I said I shouldn&#39;t write Li. Don&#39;t even mention it. Chen said, &quot;what&#39;s 
the matter?&quot; The meaning is all right.<br>
<br>
I sometimes sing and shake hands like a star concert. There was a patient, a fat 
man. When I first came in, I was in the next bed with him. I heard the health 
worker chatting and asked them to stop arguing. They stopped talking. But soon I 
quarreled with the fat man and talked all the time. I also said that fighting 
was punching and trying to show him. He is very much like my college classmate 
shixiaoye. Later, his condition became worse. He lay all day without talking. 
His father and his mother came to accompany him every day.<br>
<br>
One day, his mother and his sister came to accompany him and sat on the bed. 
There were two patients. I shook hands while singing. I shook hands with the 
patient and his mother. When I came to his sister&#39;s place, of course, I was 
embarrassed to shake hands. I half stretched out my hand and smiled, and his 
sister smiled.<br>
<br>
There was a young man who was anonymous. The head nurse named him zhouwenbin. We 
both felt funny together. I don&#39;t know how he knew that I called myself 
Tangbohu. Once, he called me to the bathroom and said to me, &quot;you are Tangbohu, 
and I am zhouwenbin.&quot; I immediately laughed. That time, they were very happy.<br>
<br>
Later, there were many anonymous people in the hospital. There were four or five 
wards in each ward. The government provided assistance. The homeless people were 
accepted by the rescue station. They could not explain the situation at the 
rescue station. If the rescue station thought it was abnormal, they were sent to 
the mental hospital and given medicine. However, there are often family members 
who are contacted and picked up by the rescue station. Sometimes they come to 
the hospital to take photos of anonymous so that they can be recognized by the 
family members.<br>
<br>
Once a nurse saw a missing person notice when she was taking a bus to work. The 
photo looked like an old man without a name in the hospital. She just flashed 
past the bus and saw it. The search notice was from Shandong. The rescue station 
checked it according to the notice. The old man said it was from Shandong. The 
old man complained that I didn&#39;t give him anything the other day. I said you 
didn&#39;t follow me. The old man&#39;s family picked him up.<br>
<br>
There was a child who was often beaten. He was addicted to smoking. He always 
asked for cigarette butts. I gave him cigarette butts. Instead of beating him, I 
made him kneel down. Later, his brother found him and took him back. Liyuanba 
also said that his brother wanted to find someone to beat him. He also said 
about me. I said, &quot;I didn&#39;t fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
A drunk man was tied to his bed by the security guard when he came in at night. 
After two hours, his children came and said that he was not ill and had to be 
picked up. Because his family insisted, the doctor on duty asked them to go 
through the discharge formalities and pick him up.<br>
<br>
Here is the admission and discharge of the mental hospital. In hospital, it is 
usually sent by family members. A few are units. The police also have the right. 
For the first time, I was my work unit and my brother. Later, I will be family 
members. Once, several students from Jiangke University sent a classmate to be 
hospitalized. Dr. Xu Bin later said that there were legal problems and it was 
difficult to accept him.<br>
<br>
It is family members and doctors who discuss the discharge. Of course, patients 
want to leave the hospital as soon as possible. They are not free. It is the 
same as prison. However, family members usually have to listen to the doctor. 
The family members can&#39;t figure out the condition of the disease. Sometimes the 
doctor cares more about the patient for the sake of economic interests. Needless 
to say, this situation is much better now.<br>
<br>
As mentioned earlier, if the family members refuse to answer, they will not be 
able to leave the hospital (at public expense). A patient, Wu, said that his 
wife said, &quot;let him out, and I will commit suicide.&quot; He has recovered and helped 
with his work. He takes the patient&#39;s blood pressure every morning, but no one 
answers, so he can&#39;t get out of the hospital. Another patient, zhuzhiyong, has 
been living here for 20 years. He works like a patient housekeeper. The nurse 
said a long time ago, &quot;what&#39;s wrong with zhuzhiyong? He&#39;s completely recovered.&quot;<br>
<br>
If it is a crime, such as wounding people, the police sent it, and the court 
sentenced it to imprisonment for treatment, the family members and doctors will 
not be able to decide to leave the hospital. The court decided that it was 
sentenced to two years, and the two-year period must expire. Therefore, it is 
usually said that &quot;neuropathy wounding people does not break the law, and does 
not go to prison.&quot; It is wrong to go to prison (in custody for treatment) 
according to the same sentence. According to the facts of the case, the normal 
person is sentenced to two years and imprisoned in prison for two years. In the 
same case, the mentally ill person is imprisoned in a mental hospital for two 
years.<br>
<br>

Chapter 17<br>
<br>
When I was excited, I would take the initiative to look for beggars in the 
street and give them cigarettes and money. Even when I gave a speech in the 
hospital last time, a student said that I was the leader of the beggars&#39; sect.<br>
<br>
Once at the entrance of Wanfang supermarket in Nanmen Street, a disabled beggar 
of about 20 years old was begging with a loudspeaker. I put a few dollars in a 
bowl, thought about it, moved my heart, put Zhang Mao Zedong in his hand, and he 
held it tightly.<br>
<br>
Once, at the entrance of the supermarket, a young man, like a beggar, was riding 
on his bicycle. I came forward and made a cigarette. He lit it. I had a 
cigarette and took out the lighter. Strangely, the lighter was broken down in my 
pocket. The young man took his cigarette to me for fire. I was amused and lit 
his fire.<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;here&#39;s 5 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He shook his head. I slapped him and 
asked him, &quot;here is 5 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He nodded and I gave him 5 yuan.<br>
<br>
Then I said, &quot;here&#39;s 20 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He shook his head. I slapped him 
and asked him, &quot;here is 20 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He nodded and I gave him 20 
yuan.<br>
<br>
Then I said, &quot;here is 100 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He shook his head. I slapped 
him and asked him, &quot;here is 100 yuan. Do you want it?&quot; He nodded and I gave him 
100 yuan.<br>
<br>
Then I went home. Afterwards, I heard my wife say that the people in the shop at 
the door saw it and laughed. They told my wife.<br>
<br>
There was an old man, Hongqigong, who asked me for money. Later, he got along 
with me like a friend for some time. Sometimes when I gave him money, he 
stretched out his hand. Because of the broken hand, I moved my heart and gave 
him another 20 or so. Once, we sat at the gate of a northeast restaurant. I 
bought drinks for both of us. An old beggar came to ask for money. I gave him 20 
yuan, but Qigong offered more. I found 5 yuan in his hand. I just gave it to 
him. I caught up with the old beggar and got back 20 yuan.<br>
<br>
I also gave him an old mobile phone. My wife and son asked me why I often gave 
him money. I said, &quot;when he is Hongqigong and I am Guojing, he may be good for 
me in the future.&quot;<br>
<br>
That time, at the South Gate night market, at the North intersection, on the 
roadside of central Shandong Province, there was a young disabled beggar lying 
in the middle of the road. I gave him 20, as well as some small kumquats I just 
bought. Then I asked passers-by to give me love, which is usually a big ocean. 
An elder sister heard from a distance and said to give me love and put down one 
yuan.<br>
<br>
But most people didn&#39;t give it. I pestered a girl. Her boyfriend accused me of 
pestering. I said, &quot;to show love.&quot; He said, &quot;why don&#39;t you offer it?&quot; I said, &quot;I 
gave 20, but the dog didn&#39;t.&quot; The other party had already walked towards the 
South and was still blaming me for pestering. I said, &quot;you want to fight, come 
on.&quot; The girl dared to drag him away.<br>
<br>
The disabled beggar said that when others thought I was a matchmaker, I was 
speechless and left.<br>
<br>
That night was very funny. I bought a cup of coffee for 8 yuan. The coffee 
seller also reminded me that it would affect sleep. I said, &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot; 
The last few yuan of his money was given to a young man who was in good health.<br>
<br>
Once I went to work in the morning and got off the bus. I lit a cigarette. A 
young man across the street greeted me with a smile. I gave him the cigarette on 
his mouth. He took it and put it in his mouth. They walked forward respectively. 
I lit another cigarette and finished at one go.<br>
<br>
At that noon, I was playing in dashikou. In a jewelry store, I said to the 
landlady, &quot;let me see.&quot; She said, &quot;come here and see.&quot; There is a beautiful 
woman there. She is very beautiful and fashionable, so I have an eye on her. 
When she left, I followed her. When she came to Wanxiang and went up the stairs, 
I followed her. At the top of the stairs, she turned back and asked me, &quot;why do 
you always follow me?&quot; I was speechless. Then she turned and went downstairs. I 
said, &quot;I want to go downstairs, too.&quot; He went downstairs and a salesman laughed.<br>
<br>
I stopped following her and went home. The girl in front of me stepped on her 
feet. She found out and scolded: &quot;crazy.&quot; I scolded her little B and claimed to 
beat her little B. she was afraid and hid in a clothing store. I still claimed 
to go in and beat her at the door. The store owner came out and gave me a 
cigarette. I said, &quot;I&#39;m not crazy. You call me crazy.&quot; the boss said, &quot;that 
won&#39;t work.&quot; I said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Then he said, &quot;I&#39;m crazy. You call me 
crazy. I&#39;ll fight with you.&quot; The boss continued to say hello, and I said, &quot;give 
me a cigarette.&quot; He walked away with a smile.<br>
<br>
That morning, in Nanmen Street, a woman met me and said, &quot;hello.&quot; She said, 
&quot;crazy.&quot;, She walked north. I asked her to apologize. I turned around and 
followed her. I met a female cleaner. I stopped and told her about it. Cleaner 
said she should apologize. Strangely, the woman stopped not far away and waited 
for me. I caught up with her. She said, &quot;I apologize to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
That night at dashikou, at the gate of Suning, there was a girl riding a bike 
and two men with me. I said to the girl across the fence, &quot;hello.&quot; They stopped, 
two men greeted the man behind them, and turned over the fence. I was not 
afraid. I said, &quot;what&#39;s wrong with me saying hello?&quot; The man in the back put his 
arm around my clothes. They turned over again and left. I also thought: &quot;if Gao 
Niu B (see Volume 2 Jianghu years) is here, you won&#39;t be killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 18<br>
<br>
The shortest person in Zhenjiang No. 4 hospital was an old man, only 1 hour. The 
old man went through the formalities and came in. He found that he couldn&#39;t get 
out. He hurried to leave. The medical staff took the protective belt and wanted 
to tie him up. The old lady felt distressed and couldn&#39;t say anything. She went 
home and went to hospital.<br>
<br>
There was a young man who was very impressive. He sat down with me and asked me 
why I pretended to be him. I said how old you are and how old I am. He stopped 
talking. Once I gave him beef, but he didn&#39;t want it. I kicked his foot. After a 
while, he pushed me on the back. Wang Ming (Wang Ping, I call him Wang Ming, an 
old patient, who can&#39;t get out, just like a housekeeper) came to protect me. The 
nurse was also there. I said I would kick him first.<br>
<br>
Once Wang Ming wanted to stop my cigarettes. I said, &quot;how dare you stop Mao 
Zedong&#39;s cigarettes?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mental hospitals, like prisons, use patients to manage patients. I was 
dissatisfied with this. I told director quhongfang, &quot;our party has always been 
subordinate to its superiors, the minority to the majority, and the whole party 
to the Central Committee. How can we manage at the same level?&quot; Song makes you 
laugh.<br>
<br>
I said to the head nurse, &quot;steamed buns and porridge for breakfast are still my 
food in high school.&quot; The head nurse said to balance something.<br>
<br>
There was a young man named xiaozhenjiang, who was not very tall. His mother 
also lived upstairs. The nurse took pity on him and gave him some takeaway food. 
Sometimes, when he saw the nurse eating takeaway food in the room, he took a 
spoon and waited in the corridor early. Sometimes when there is too much left, 
other patients also come to share and rob. The small town Jiang said, &quot;you eat 
the potatoes and give me the ribs.&quot;<br>
<br>
A fellow Jurong a said that his wife lived on the fifth floor, saw the TV on 
Dongqing, and said that he liked her best:) a was always noisy, so the 
housekeepers and health workers took him to bed and tied him up. He said that he 
was just sleeping.<br>
<br>
I often give dumb guys and a man B something to eat. They are the same as me. I 
don&#39;t have anything. I also get something for them. I did it twice. One morning, 
a ate pancakes. I went to do it. A didn&#39;t agree with him. I hit him hard on the 
head. After a while, I sat on my seat. A sneaked in the back and hit my glasses 
on the ground. Wang Ming immediately tied him up and told his sister to pay for 
his glasses when she came to see him. Of course I wouldn&#39;t. the glasses were 
metal. I bent my legs and continued to wear them. I said to hit him on the head 
first. Wang Ming said that his nature had changed.<br>
<br>
An old man said that when he was young, he would build the country and now give 
it to my generation. I told a nurse that my generation would give it to her 
generation.<br>
<br>
At noon, a new patient came in and tied him to the bed. I said in the corridor, 
&quot;Ge Yimin is not as tall as Andy Lau, not as rich as Andy Lau, not as handsome 
as Andy Lau.&quot; &quot;I am inferior to Jiang Zemin in three respects,&quot; he said, 
imitating Zhu Rongji<br>
<br>
There was a man like wendebei (teacher) in my village. He saw a patient named 
&quot;Xiaxu&quot; and was afraid to say; &quot;Blood&quot;, I said nothing. My colleague&#39;s husband 
was also called &quot;Liu Xu&quot;. He liked to talk about communism with me. When it came 
to Russian aggression and borders, I said, &quot;the Communist border is 
meaningless.&quot; He basically agreed with me, and made some language and 
expression. Once we were tied to the bench, just like Jesus on the cross. We sat 
on the bench with our hands stretched out and tied. We got up and walked with 
the bench. It was very funny. The health worker stopped us.<br>
<br>
I think people are face blind. When I came in this time, I thought a doctor was 
Zhang Wei. I went to her and said, &quot;you said that it was me who came down from 
e, but it hurt me. I believe it.&quot; She said, &quot;I won&#39;t tell you.&quot; Go away.<br>
<br>
There is something very strange. Before I was hospitalized, my wife said to me, 
&quot;Yimin, what changes have you found?&quot; I said, &quot;what has changed?&quot; &quot;You always 
run to the bathroom,&quot; she said<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XIX<br>
<br>
This time, there are two beautiful women, nurse jiangbiyun and a beautiful 
doctor. They are plump and sexy. They like to wear yellow clothes. During the 
ward round, I care more about her than my doctor (who is also a woman). I said 
to her, &quot;doctor, you are so beautiful.&quot; She always said, &quot;thank you.&quot; Jiang 
Biyun and the beautiful doctor were in my mind all day. When my wife took me out 
of the hospital, she suddenly felt that she was too old to recognize her.<br>
<br>
Doctors are very patriotic. During the military parade in Russia, there was a 
live show in the small activity room. My doctor came in and said, &quot;I just want 
to see us.&quot; It refers to the honor guard of invited Chinese soldiers.<br>
<br>
The volunteer J I wrote in this novel is sensitive. The police station told me 
to report from other places and asked me to write an appraisal in the hospital. 
Dr. zhoujuanjuan wrote it for me. I said it lightly, but I didn&#39;t tell her the 
most important thing. I said it was inappropriate to write a volunteer J in the 
hospital. Just as the Changjin Lake praised volunteer J, she wrote me boasting 
and making inappropriate remarks. She said I was excited. I said, &quot;talking to 
you, you make me a little excited.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t let the police bring you in,&quot; she 
said<br>
<br>
Of course, the agricultural materials colleagues in our province are very 
patriotic, and the colleagues are patriotic every day. It seems that 
zhangxianzhong is a minority after all.<br>
<br>
The last time, on the eve of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party 
of China, male doctors in the outpatient department were flushed with energy. I 
think so. He said it was all right. This time, the arrangement was very good. 
She was a woman doctor. She knew that I had published a Book (i.e. nerves).<br>
<br>
There are also elderly patients who care about politics. Seven standing 
committee members were elected and told me which of them. What&#39;s more, I thought 
I could be among the members and alternate members. After reading the list, I 
was still a little disappointed.<br>
<br>
At noon, the CCTV news broadcast an activity of the central government, and 
finally said, &quot;the establishment will not be increased.&quot; I said to Zhang Wei, 
&quot;Andy Lau and I have been busy for a while. It is useless. There is no staff.&quot; 
Zhang Wei said, &quot;who is Andy Lau?&quot; I said, &quot;Bian zhengliu&quot; (that is, we call 
each other &quot;Huazai&quot;). Zhang Wei said, &quot;is he Andy Lau?&quot; I said, &quot;in a few days, 
he will be Andy Lau.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;dear, open your mouth. The fragrance of flowers in the wind will make 
you intoxicated.&quot; Sing &quot;dear, let&#39;s dance. A burst of fragrance will make you 
intoxicated.&quot; Then I stood behind the female nurse and the female doctor to 
smell the hair fragrance. In fact, it was shampoo. It really had a fragrance. 
Once I couldn&#39;t smell the fragrance on the head nurse&#39;s hair, so I said, &quot;the 
fragrant imperial concubine doesn&#39;t smell any more. She&#39;s going to fly away.&quot; 
The head nurse hurriedly asked something. I said, &quot;your hair doesn&#39;t smell good. 
You have to go.&quot; She laughed, not angry. Of course, there are also old patients 
who can&#39;t stand me smelling women. Imagine the dance hall smelling the fragrance 
of beauty. It&#39;s really intoxicating. And &quot;honey, you fly with me through the 
jungle to see the stream.&quot; I changed it to &quot;go through the jungle to listen to 
the brook.&quot; I think &quot;listening&quot; is better than &quot;watching&quot;. There are sounds and 
images.<br>
<br>
I am always excited when I first enter the hospital. My illness is just excited. 
I will give a speech on the bathroom bed, which is about the two major (Chapter 
18 of Neurology: socialized mass production and the Internet revolution). I can 
give a speech for a long time. I am quick thinking and eloquent, just like 
Lenin&#39;s speechless speech. An old patient said, &quot;that&#39;s all for mania. It&#39;ll be 
all right in two days.&quot; Mania comes and goes quickly.<br>
<br>
At the time of onset, I was in a state of mania and excitement. I liked singing 
(expressing my feelings) and exile (walking aimlessly, also expressing my 
feelings). Every time, I thought I was a great person. I was excited once and 
realized that I said to my mother, &quot;I wish I could sing or not join the army.&quot; 
my mother said, &quot;yes.&quot;. But every time I suddenly think I&#39;m great, I feel 
excited and can&#39;t control my humble life as usual.<br>
<br>
The mental hospital, however, serves as an &quot;isolation&quot; and &quot;shut-off&quot;. It has no 
other function. When you are at home, you can go to the streets to join the army 
and sing while walking. The more you walk, the more excited you sing. After the 
hospital is closed for a few days, you will feel nothing and gradually resume 
your humble life. Taking medicine is the same as taking it at home and in the 
hospital. The doctor has no other treatment, but the word &quot;off&quot; makes you less 
and less excited.<br>
<br>
In the early days of hospitalization, there were also patients (young men) who 
said, &quot;s is dead&quot; and called me &quot;brother Ge&quot; and &quot;brother-in-law&quot;. Like my 
brother-in-law, they sometimes called me &quot;handsome&quot;, and then they called me 
&quot;God&quot; (in the 1990s), saying that I was an idol.<br>
<br>
The leaders of the provincial agricultural means of production also said to my 
parents, &quot;Ge Yimin is talented, but he is ill.&quot; I was assigned as the chief of 
the personal secretary section of caiguangyi (he was promoted to Secretary). If 
I hadn&#39;t been ill, I would have gone to Nanjing later. I don&#39;t know what the 
situation will be like.<br>
<br>
Of course, nerve 12 164. If I am within the system, there will be no God net, 
nerve God, and mankind will always be in the dark, like a long night.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XX<br>
<br>
The treatment methods in psychiatric hospitals are taking medicine and binding. 
There was electric acupuncture before, but now it is basically not done. It is 
said that it is cruel, inhumane, and violates human rights. There is less 
electric shock. It&#39;s easy to understand that taking medicine can stabilize your 
mood and control your brain&#39;s displeasure. Binding is a big means. The doctors 
and nurses call it protection. There are five bindings in total, namely, five 
colorful ones, and the neck and chest doctors and nurses call it a big belt. 
Single protection, double protection, three protection... Distinguish between 
hands and feet, such as double protection, with two hands or one hand and one 
foot. Of course, the most serious is the five protections of hands, feet, neck 
and chest:) I have learned many times. Once I was tied too tightly, I felt 
uncomfortable breathing. I shouted to loosen up, and the nurses and health 
workers ignored them. Fortunately, I fell asleep soon.<br>
<br>
When a new patient comes in, he is tied to his bed. Doctors, nurses, health 
workers and dog leg patients will all participate. Sometimes I also participate. 
I learn a move. The patient struggles hard. When I cover his mouth with a 
pillow, he becomes bored. Of course, I can only cover it for a little while. 
Director Yao Hongxiu once reminded me.<br>
<br>
Fights are common in the bathroom. I once talked with Wang Ming in the bathroom 
and said that fighting was boring. Wang Ming said, &quot;Be busy with money&quot;:)<br>
<br>
I want to go out and send a banner to Tao Lingwei, thinking about what words to 
write. If someone sends a banner, nurses or doctors will be rewarded. Speaking 
to Jia Jianqing, she advised me not to give it away for fear that I would spend 
money. Later, when I mentioned it to her again, she said, &quot;I want it too.&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am interested in Pi. I clearly remember what the primary school teacher said: 
&quot;A lion and a pot of wine on the top of the mountain. After two deer dance, we 
can eat wine and kill people. &quot;I was very impressed, but I was hospitalized many 
times (I call it a trial), and it was just&quot; I can&#39;t kill you &quot;, looking forward 
to&quot; Le Er Le &quot;. I once put 3.14159 leaves on the table in the activity room... 
Director Tian Zhihong saw that, of course, he could not understand, so he asked 
me to take it away.<br>
<br>
When Li Xiannian was the President of the country, a patient and a doctor said, 
&quot;If you want to be the President of the country, Li Xiannian can be, and I can 
be.&quot;:)<br>
<br>
In that speech to a group of medical students about communism, I said that the 
hospital did not eat well, but learned to eat well. A boy said, &quot;I&#39;m not good at 
eating.&quot;:)<br>
<br>
After the first hospitalization, my family asked a fortune teller and the witch 
said, &quot;I have two PLA men and a woman in my body.&quot;<br>
<br>
And Jia Jianqing said: &quot;Everyone has a bank (referring to selling blood), while 
women have two banks (selling...)&quot;<br>
<br>
Once, an accompanying elder sister gave me fried dough sticks to eat, but I 
refused, saying, &quot;Don&#39;t give a needle to the masses.&quot; She said something 
serious. I do have a characteristic that I don&#39;t eat other people&#39;s food. For 
example, I don&#39;t smoke other people&#39;s cigarettes at work. I don&#39;t accept any 
cigarettes from customers. I think I&#39;m the last Red Army.<br>
<br>
By the way, the beautiful doctor mentioned last time is Xu Jiaoyi. Director 
Chang Xianlu, I asked him, &quot;Are you a Party member?&quot; A: &quot;Of course.&quot; Well, I&#39;m 
very proud. When I talked about communism with him, he said, &quot;Who else believes 
this now?&quot; I said, &quot;You are a Party member, but you say so?&quot; He immediately 
walked away with a smile.<br>
<br>
A patient named Zhang Aimin, for example, how old he is, sometimes he can&#39;t take 
care of himself. He urinates on his body and quilt. Nurses and health workers 
deal with the quilts and pillows that have urinated. They just dry them on the 
balcony and continue to give them to the patient without washing them. He took a 
copy of The Outlaws of the Marsh with him when he was in hospital. He read it 
every day and read a page for half a day. I called him an expert on the study of 
the marsh. He was very familiar with the nickname of 108 heroes. Li Yuanba still 
admired it and pulled me to listen. I said, &quot;What&#39;s the use of knowing this?&quot; 
His mother takes care of him. His mother likes me very much and likes talking 
with me. Although she is old, she is dignified and likes to wear red clothes. 
Once when I saw her, I was so considerate of her hardships that I cried loudly 
inside. When the nurse asked why, I said I saw her.<br>
<br>
Once I met her on Zhengdong Road, she asked, &quot;How about Zhang Aimin?&quot; Of course, 
I said it was OK. She said, &quot;It&#39;s not good at home. It&#39;s better to put it 
inside.&quot; Later, she died, and I happened to be in the hospital. Jia Jianqing 
asked Zhang Aimin to go home to mourn. Zhang Aimin just wore red clothes and 
didn&#39;t know his mother died. Jia Jianqing found a white T-shirt and changed it 
for him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XXI<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It&#39;s a big problem to live together and snore. One person likes Ren Xianqi&#39;s 
song &quot;Sad Pacific&quot;. At that time, the TV can play U disk songs, so he asked to 
play this song. He snored seriously. One night, when he was sleeping, his voice 
was too loud and he was at my bedside. I said to Zhang, the health worker, &quot;How 
can I sleep when my voice is so loud?&quot; After a while, the voice was low, and the 
health worker dared to say: &quot;Stop fighting and go to sleep.&quot; The previous 
article liked Dong Qing&#39;s Jurong fellow villager A, who said to his Pacific 
mother, &quot;He snores, and I hit him in the face with my shoes. His mother is 
nervous, and A said she won&#39;t really hit him.&quot;.<br>
<br>
Pacific&#39;s mother accompanies him in the hospital almost every day. She brings 
him a cake cutter and some fruit in the morning. Once, I saw his mother lying on 
the ground at the entrance of the nurse station, crying and making noises. I 
went to drag her. The head nurse said not to drag her, but that it was damaged. 
I stopped. Finally, she said, &quot;Good, long live the head nurse.&quot;.<br>
<br>
One night, it was Pacific snoring. Zhang, the health worker, asked me to sleep 
in another room. I said there was no quilt. He said, &quot;I&#39;ll take it. &quot;He picked 
up my old quilt and took me away. I was a little scared. When I entered the 
room, I didn&#39;t turn on the light. I was lying on the middle bed, and he slapped 
the quilt on me. There were old people around me who were whispering. I thought 
that there was an old central leader like Chen Yun in this room, which was very 
mysterious.<br>
<br>
A young man, C, was very angry. His mother wanted to take him out of the 
hospital. Somehow she quarreled with the nurse, and she scolded. The nurse said, 
&quot;Why are you so cruel?&quot; When he heard this, he walked to the nurse and shouted, 
&quot;Just be cruel. How about scolding?&quot; At that time, Zhang Wei, the doctor, was 
also standing beside the nurse, at the entrance of the nurse station. C If I 
wanted to beat Zhang Wei and the nurse, I dared to hurry up and hold him and 
scold him for beating women. Zhang Wei said, &quot;If you don&#39;t leave the hospital, 
I&#39;ll find someone to tie you up.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a while, I saw him lying on the bed with water. I said, &quot;Thank you for not 
leaving the hospital.&quot; He said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? &quot;I said,&quot; We can play together, 
&quot;but he was discharged the next day.<br>
<br>
A man, D, in his 40s, lived for a few days and wanted to leave the hospital. His 
family found a relationship to leave the hospital. In fact, what relationship 
was he looking for? I won&#39;t see a doctor, can&#39;t I? At dinner, he didn&#39;t leave, 
but stopped working. The patient Wu (his wife threatened to commit suicide if he 
was discharged from hospital) said to him, &quot;We will save you. &quot;D doesn&#39;t like to 
hear it. When he answers something, Wu says,&quot; Come on, let&#39;s fight. &quot;D said,&quot; I 
dare not, Master Fu, you are strong. “<br>
<br>
Director Chang Xianlu talked to me that time, and I said, &quot;I believe that our 
Party members and cadres serve the people, but one corrupt official here and one 
corrupt official there, why? Train the people and test Ge Yimin. “<br>
<br>
The food in the mental hospital is always poor. After the price was raised, it 
was still the case. When the nurse asked the patient to make an investigation, 
the patient always said that the food was poor. I ordered steamed stuffed buns 
for breakfast, and boxed meals for lunch and evening. But boxed meals are also 
unpleasant. After eating Luocai, I can&#39;t eat vegetables and meals. They eat 
fast. I always end up with a lot of food left.<br>
<br>
There was a boy whose mother was so beautiful and sexy. I gave him steamed buns 
for many days, and he was not polite when I ate his steamed buns. Once his 
mother and his aunt were in the reception room, and I also sat down. The male 
hygienist asked me to leave.<br>
<br>
Once when I was sitting on a fucking porch bed, I helped the nurse in the 
innermost room. I came out and went back to my room. When I passed by her, I 
said, &quot;The property is public, everyone is equal, and no one is allowed to 
starve or freeze.&quot; &quot;Only when all people have the same living conditions can we 
be carefree, loving and happy. Therefore, we must share wealth, abolish the 
monetary system, use all wealth equally, distribute labor equally, distribute 
products equally, and enjoy them equally. Everyone has the right to own and 
enjoy so many things that they need but cannot exceed. No one has the right to 
pursue more consumption and less labor. No one can get more enjoyment and engage 
in less work because he has more knowledge. Otherwise, he is an aristocrat. 
&quot;Humans who are mature to the perfection of the earth are crops, and the common 
possession of earthly wealth is the first fruit of such crops.&quot; According to the 
commandment of love, harvest the fruits of mature human beings - wealth is 
shared. “<br>
<br>
It was the content of &quot;Nerve&quot; (the Shinto Declaration). Of course, I didn&#39;t say 
so much at that time. She smiled when she patted a patient on the shoulder.<br>

Volume 4 Ge Shen and his women(august1990 – present)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter I<br>
<br>
One night in the summer of 1989 (the third of NANDA University), we went to a 
ferry in Nanjing (Zhongshan wharf) with Xia Liwen, the &quot;master&quot;, to cross the 
river to visit Jianghu people. Because there was still time for the boat to 
meet, we stopped by the roadside at the gate. A woman, older than me, asked me 
where I was going? I said Jiang, she didn&#39;t go away. Standing in front of me, I 
understood and took her. She took out some of my pockets and put them back. 
(after going back, Xia reminds me that she took me 10 yuan). She took me to the 
wall. Because it was dark, she unzipped my pants and put them inside her. 
Because I didn&#39;t know how to move, she took them out for a while and left. When 
I crossed the river, I was still swollen. Later, I was ridiculed by the Jianghu 
brothers Gao Niu B and Yang for carrying half a pot.<br>
<br>
In the room where I was on duty in the southwest building, Weiqin (a pseudonym, 
the same below) showed me breasts. Did I say there was milk? She says it&#39;s only 
possible to have children. Later, she called me a plane at the drum tower 
English corner.<br>
<br>
I met Zhang Qin on the street and took her to my dorm. Xia and her Z, Xia said 
to me, you go in and say virgin for the first time. I went in and told the 
truth. She said that she couldn&#39;t affect me. We didn&#39;t have Z.<br>
<br>
I took Hong Bing to the dormitory for the night and stayed in the TV room. I 
said she was not a virgin. She immediately took off her pants and showed it to 
me. I looked at it and felt nothing. When I was a student, I was so pure that I 
didn&#39;t understand the wind and the moon.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1991 (already working in Zhenjiang), he was fond of ballroom 
dancing. Generally, he was in the ballroom opposite the company. The dance floor 
was very large and there were many people. Once I was very speculative with a 
woman (zhoudongfeng), who was in her 30s. After that, I made an appointment to 
go to my dorm to play. We are Z. she is like a white tiger, very white. The next 
day, it was Sunday. She bought me some buns and a box of Hongtashan.<br>
<br>
I met zhangqiuying in the ballroom of the stadium. She is over 30 years old. We 
danced a few songs and made an appointment to go to the toilet outside. Then we 
danced back and left a phone. She was sincere to me. She came to me on a date. 
It was raining hard, but she still came. There was a lover&#39;s road near the 
canal. We dated at night. She said that she didn&#39;t need to take off her shorts. 
There were buttons on the side. She could just untie them. She specially wore 
them. They were worn by ships. Once a man followed us. After I returned to the 
dormitory, I asked for her Z. she said no. the man said that you and he 
(referring to me) Z. she said that we were in love.<br>
<br>
Yanfengying also met at the dance floor. At that time, women were very open and 
no one asked for money. When we Z, it makes a loud noise. Come to me again, at 
the iron gate Z. Later I met her in the ballroom and asked her why she didn&#39;t 
come to me? She said you had a woman. She was honest.<br>
<br>
One morning in the summer of 1991, I was going to dance in the gym. My unit had 
five monthly tickets. Before the time came, I saw a young woman in a green dress 
at the door. She was in a very good shape. She was walking on the road to the 
small stadium. I thought she would dance in general. I thought I would ask her 
to dance when I went in. She is my later girlfriend HuangFei, a physical 
education teacher.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, I invited her to dance. She agreed, and we danced all the time. She 
danced very well, especially fast. She led me to spin.<br>
<br>
After that, I asked her to my dormitory and left a phone. I have been with her 
for more than one year. I once wrote a diary because I was afraid of being 
discovered when I talked with my wife. The diary burned on the balcony of my 
unit. Now I think it&#39;s a pity that the history of shenism has been obliterated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter II<br>
<br>
Huang Fei and I talk on the phone almost every day. She often comes to my 
dormitory after work. Sometimes she waits for me in the dormitory before I get 
off work. Of course, we often went dancing. At that time, there was no Internet 
or mobile phone. Dancing was our biggest hobby. Sometimes in general, a group of 
her students were also inside. When she was young, the students surrounded us in 
a big circle. We pulled in the middle and the students pulled around.<br>
<br>
At that time, people still loved to watch movies. When we watched them, she 
always ate a plum blossom and vomited it in my mouth.<br>
<br>
One Christmas, my junior high school classmate wangguofang took us and others 
out to the dance by bike. After looking for the night show, it turned out that 
the night show was last Christmas Eve. I was surprised that Jesus had not yet 
been born on Christmas Eve. Shouldn&#39;t it be Christmas to celebrate the birth of 
Jesus?<br>
<br>
Once Wang Guofang organized a dance in her unit Dantu radio station and invited 
us to go. Huang Fei brought a lot of soft candy. Because Huang Fei&#39;s feet are 
big, we change our shoes. I&#39;m tight and can bear it. Later wangguofang told me 
that they both thought we were a good match and even envied us.<br>
<br>
Of course, before long, we were both Z.<br>
<br>
At that time, they were very open to sex. One night, we chatted up a woman 
downstairs of the company. We went to the next yard. It was a night school. We 
leaned against the wall. The so-called swallow flew against the wall. After 
leaving the hospital, the guard blamed us for opening the gate. When I came out 
to a restaurant downstairs, I paid dozens of yuan. She said she would pay. I 
said, &quot;seriously?&quot;, She took out 50 and gave it to me. I took it for a while and 
gave it back to her. Because I want to go back to the dormitory, the old doorman 
can&#39;t be too late. She wants me to accompany her more, but she doesn&#39;t want to.<br>
<br>
Wangmumei is a native of Northern Jiangsu. She is several years older than me. 
She also met me dancing. It was in Donggong. After I invited her to my 
dormitory, she had several companions who rode with us. I said to them, are you 
in this direction? And they rode off in another way, grumbling.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll take wangmumei to my dormitory and we&#39;ll be Z. She stayed on the phone with 
me for a long time. At that time, Hualian Commercial Building held a shopping 
lottery and gave me a coupon to buy something. When will the lottery come. She 
said she would give me her ticket and take it to me.<br>
<br>
One morning, when I was at work, wangmumei rode to the downstairs of my company 
to find me. We went to my dormitory Z, Z once, she said J, then Z, she was high 
C, she said we were high C at the same time, very satisfied.<br>
<br>
On a Sunday day, the old doorman looked at my dormitory for a while. Wangmumei 
found out and I had to leave the door open.<br>
<br>
Once the company gave her a bag of apples. I asked wangmumei to give it to her 
son to eat. I was a little reluctant. I wanted to give it to my brother and 
sister-in-law. She and I have given her a bag of apples so many times. It&#39;s 
incredible today. So women didn&#39;t want money at that time.<br>
<br>
One night, when I was late dancing with Huang Fei, she took me to eat 
casseroles. I saw a bowl full and said I couldn&#39;t eat it. She said it was just 
one layer above. Sure enough, there was soup underneath. It was too late. If I 
went back to the dormitory, it would be too late. She took me to her house to 
sleep and let me fall down with her brother. His brother was already asleep. I 
took off my clothes and went into his brother&#39;s bed.<br>
<br>
The next morning, we went to Jingqiao restaurant for breakfast. I was late for 
work and found a reason to prevaricate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter III<br>
<br>
When I was dancing, I always invited girls I didn&#39;t know in the dance hall. I 
often went with my colleague tangzhihui, two bachelors, ha ha. Once someone was 
very polite and gentleman, but the girl refused. We asked to eat pancake. As I 
stood up, I said, &quot;revolution is not a dinner party. You can&#39;t be so kind, 
courteous and frugal.&quot; I ran to the girl nearby and dragged her to jump. The 
girls sitting there laughed.<br>
<br>
Once I invited a girl to eat pancake. I said, &quot;what should I do? &quot;As he spoke, 
he ran to a nearby place and dragged a girl to jump. The original girl and her 
companions laughed loudly.<br>
<br>
Once I asked a girl to dance. She was dressed in red and her companion was 
dressed in black. I said you two were a novel. What novel did she say? I said 
red and black.<br>
<br>
Once a colleague Bao Ping and his wife were in general. I talked to them. The 
dance music sounded. I said not to delay my business. I got up and went to find 
the girl. Bao Ping&#39;s wife laughed.<br>
<br>
Next to my dormitory, there is a factory. There are two female workers, all 
girls. They are my fellow Jurong. Once they brought a girl to play, named 
yejiezhi, from Anhui. Later, yejiezhi came to my dormitory alone. They knew that 
they were not happy and looked down upon her.<br>
<br>
Once ye Jiezhi and I were in the dormitory. I reached out to touch her private 
place. She struggled. My hands were full of yellow water.<br>
<br>
Once, when my brother came, she didn&#39;t go. My brother said to go, I said to go, 
and she still didn&#39;t go.<br>
<br>
Many years later, ye Jiezhi opened a smoking hotel on Dianli road. I was married 
and joked that she would be her lover. She said that the lover would meet twice 
a week.<br>
<br>
There was a girl named Dingdang, who was also known by dancing. At that time, 
the dance music had a song &quot;special love for special you&quot;. When I danced with 
her, I said to her, &quot;special love for special you&quot;. She worked in SHANGXIA, 
southern China. Once, our company issued benefits and asked for reimbursement of 
clothing invoices. Ding Dong tore a blank invoice and gave it to me. I took it 
to my unit. Ai Yun looked at it and said that other people&#39;s invoices had been 
solved. Dingdang is very nice. I thought later that it would be good if I 
married her.<br>
<br>
When a girl came to my dormitory, I hugged her. She said, &quot;please show me some 
respect&quot;. It was too formal diplomatic language. I immediately let go and said I 
was sorry.<br>
<br>
There is a typing and copying shop at the door of the company. At the place 
where we copy, once I asked a girl there to dance in the evening. She said to 
think about it. I said to jump, or not to jump. What should I think about? I had 
to go home and ask my mother. They laughed.<br>
<br>
One Sunday, Huang Fei asked me to dance. She happened to have a partner. I asked 
them to go first. I was at the ticket office and wanted to find a girl. At this 
time, there was a girl (Leng Xue, the most beautiful Chinese girl in her mind), 
who was very beautiful. She wore a white skirt. The tickets were sold out. I 
happened to have a monthly ticket for my unit. I took her in and danced with 
her. I ignored Huang Fei when I saw her. After that, I took her to my dormitory. 
She cooked my yam for us to eat and gave her coffee. The guard liuchangfa&#39;s wife 
praised her and said how to cook the yam. When Huang Fei came to see lengxue 
drinking the coffee I prepared for her, she was jealous. Two girls were in my 
dormitory at the same time. The scene was very embarrassing. Later, Huang Fei 
said that she thought I was waiting for Wang Guofang at the ticket office. Leng 
Xue was so beautiful. She had never seen such a beautiful girl in Zhenjiang. She 
should only be in Hong Kong. Colleague liwenning also glanced at cold snow in my 
dormitory.<br>
<br>
Leng Xue told me that she worked in the electrical control room of Jianbi Power 
Plant. She had two brothers who especially protected her. She also said that my 
brother did not protect me. Who did he protect?<br>
<br>
At that time, I wanted to take Huang Fei back to my hometown in Jurong. I told 
my family that for some unknown reason, Huang Fei didn&#39;t go with me. I asked 
lengxue to pretend to be my girlfriend Huang Fei and go back to my hometown. 
Lengxue said that if she wanted to go, I would go instead of pretending to be 
someone else. For some reason, lengxue didn&#39;t go back with me.<br>
<br>
At last I went home alone and was still very sad in the car. My grandmother also 
said, &quot;if Huang Fei doesn&#39;t come, why don&#39;t you let lengxue come?&quot; My brother 
smiled and said that he could not do this.<br>
<br>
Huang Fei and I, one of my grandfathers, agreed to match each other. We said 
that one city dweller and one country dweller complemented each other. We also 
said that everything complemented each other.<br>
<br>
The last time Leng Xue called, I was not in. My colleague xuyuemei answered. Xu 
told me that a girl called for you. You were not in.<br>
<br>
Once when I was dancing in a small body, I invited a girl to dance a song. I 
went to invite someone else. After a few songs, I met her again. She asked me, 
&quot;where have you been?&quot; As soon as I heard of the play, I invited her to dance. 
She told me her name was Leng manlei, a native of Dongxiang. End, go to my dorm, 
just Z, and she specially said that this is called Z love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IV<br>
<br>
Once, I went back to my dormitory with Huang Fei in a hotel called Guangming 
Hotel opposite Huangshan shopping mall. After drinking beer, I was unhappy that 
I had no clue about marriage. She asked Z.<br>
<br>
Once I was watching a movie with Huang Fei at the people&#39;s cinema. I thought of 
the dead Sanmao. I was inexplicably sad. The Veterans General Hospital also made 
a determination to Huang Fei. I burned my little finger with a lighter. She 
stopped me. It was too late. My hand hurt for several days.<br>
<br>
Once I went to Huang Fei&#39;s school to find her. She had just finished her PE 
class and was punishing a girl for taking the shot put.<br>
<br>
Huang Fei was pregnant and knocked it out. I gave her hundreds of yuan. She 
immediately brought it back to me. I thought she was polite. She said no. It was 
an exhibition ticket for the gymnasium.<br>
<br>
When I was ill and hospitalized, Huang Fei came to my dormitory to find me. My 
parents were there. They thought I was ill because of her. They were unhappy 
with her.<br>
<br>
Once my mother and I were at my brother&#39;s place. Somehow, Huang Fei knew my 
brother&#39;s address. She didn&#39;t bring her here once, but she found it.<br>
<br>
Tangzhihui is the chef of our canteen. We call him commander Tang. He has a 
certificate as a second-class cook. I said, &quot;a second-class cook is equivalent 
to an intermediate intellectual.&quot; Wangkesheng thinks it is interesting and 
repeats it constantly. Later, commander Tang left our unit and the unit gave him 
a room by the river. There was a fat woman named Xu. Once I took the key to the 
soup and took Xu to Z. afterwards, I rode back to the city with Xu.<br>
<br>
Once I took Xu to my dormitory. I asked her to wait for me at the door. I went 
in to look for an opportunity. The old guard was there. There was no chance. 
After a long time, the old guard told me to go out. When he left, I dared to go 
to the door to find Xu. A man at the door estimated that I was looking for this 
person and told me that she had left.<br>
<br>
Dance to meet a woman named Qiang Mingying. Take her to dormitory Z and ask her 
whether her husband is comfortable or me. She says you are comfortable.<br>
<br>
Once I went back to my hometown and went back to my dormitory on Sunday. At this 
time, the dormitory had been demolished and there were only two rooms left. I 
was in the inner room and commander Tang was in the outer room. There was one 
door. When I returned, it was dark. I opened the door and cut off the power. I 
entered the room and lit the lighter. Leng manlei was in the dark. I just washed 
the quilt in my hometown, so she helped me set it.<br>
<br>
Leng manlei was pregnant. I took her to the fourth hospital and knocked her out. 
Later, I took her to a food stall. Meng Tingwei was just giving a concert at 
Zhenjiang gymnasium. According to the guests nearby, Leng manlei also whispered 
to Meng Tingwei.<br>
<br>
Once when she was in the dormitory after work, Huang Fei came by bike and wanted 
to take me to her new home. That day, she was the only one in her family. I 
stayed in her family. At the beginning, she showed me videos, which were feature 
films. Then I went to bed and told me that women should wash their bottoms. We 
went to Z. I slept naked. She had to put on her underwear. Otherwise, she was 
not used to it and couldn&#39;t sleep. We went to Z several times that night.<br>
<br>
Leng manlei wanted to marry me. Gao Jiaying, who met at the time of dancing, 
introduced me to my current wife. I dated Leng manlei again. When I broke up, I 
didn&#39;t make an appointment for the next meeting. After dancing in a dance hall, 
she waited for me to make an appointment for the next meeting. I didn&#39;t make an 
appointment on purpose.<br>
<br>
Once when my wife was in my dormitory, Leng manlei came to me. My wife didn&#39;t 
go. I sent Leng manlei away. On the way, she said that you two couldn&#39;t be 
separated for a day. She went away.<br>
<br>
On March 5th, 1993, I met my wife, got the marriage certificate in November, got 
married in February, 1994, and gave birth to a son in July. Omit it...<br>
<br>
Fanxiaoping and I danced several times. Once I sat on my bike waiting for her to 
dance. It seemed that I had waited for a long time. She greeted me when she 
arrived. I said I was good at waiting. Once in my dormitory, I asked for Z, but 
she kept deliberately yelling. She couldn&#39;t mean to be a slut. I was nervous. I 
wasn&#39;t hard. Stop it. She was an intellectual.<br>
<br>
One of my characteristics is that after breaking up with girls, I will not 
become enemies, but will become friends. When I gave birth to my son, Huang Fei 
also gave birth to a son. On the phone, she joked that she asked her son to hit 
my son.<br>
<br>
At this time, I had lived in the house assigned to me by my unit, a family of 
three, but my wife often took her son back to her mother&#39;s house, and I 
continued my happy life.<br>
<br>
There was a woman named chenshumei who came to my house once. My wife was still 
pregnant in the countryside. We were Z. As I lay on the floor, she squatted. She 
moved up and down and asked me, &quot;what is the most comfortable?&quot; I quickly 
replied, &quot;make love.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter V<br>
<br>
One evening, when Mei came to my house, Wang Kesheng was there. Wang is watching 
TV in the bedroom, Chen and I are on the small bed in the living room. I put it 
in her, and the two of them were half sitting and half lying, maintaining a 
strange posture and keeping it all the time. Wang came out to go to the 
bathroom, and we both kept it. I joked: &quot;you and his Z.&quot; She said, &quot;what do you 
think of me?&quot; It lasted so long. For a few hours, I was very sleepy. It was 
about 12 o&#39;clock. She said, &quot;I&#39;m back.&quot; I said, &quot;OK.&quot;.<br>
<br>
Later, in a general meeting, she specially told me that she had eaten cake for 
commander Tang. She was a factory worker.<br>
<br>
Once, at the end of the afternoon session, I went in and jumped. I met a woman 
dressed in a fashionable black dress. Her name was wangjiafen. She drove a taxi. 
I invited her to dinner. When my wife went back to her mother&#39;s house, I ate in 
the canteen. I bought a lot of cooked beef. We were having dinner in the office. 
Manager Cai came to see us and asked who it was? I said &quot;friend&quot;. Later, Cai 
said that she was gorgeous and that my wife was not easy to mess with.<br>
<br>
Wangjiafen and I came to my house and chatted in the bedroom. My brother-in-law 
Minghu came. I opened the door and looked back. I found that wangjiafen was not 
in the bedroom. She was hiding on the balcony. I went to call her out and said 
it was nothing. Tell Minghu that she is my classmate wangguofang. My wife knows 
Wang Guofang. They both happen to be thin. Before Minghu left, I saw Wang Jiafen 
off. It was raining and I took an umbrella. I stayed in hejianong and took her 
to the Hualian bus stop at dashikou.<br>
<br>
Wangjiafen said that she was proud of her high turning rate in the street. When 
it comes to playing outside together, the man has no money &quot;Dad&quot;, which means he 
is helpless and makes a fool of himself. She mentioned being my lover. It seems 
that she meant to keep money. I didn&#39;t agree. Once she mentioned that she was 
short of money but could not borrow it. I said I would lend it to you. She said 
that she didn&#39;t think she didn&#39;t borrow it from me. She looked down on me. I 
overdraw 1000 yuan to her with my credit card. Later, when I wanted her to pay 
back the money, I couldn&#39;t open my mouth, so I pretended to introduce someone to 
her, so that I could contact her, and showed her the photos of my college 
classmate Dai Yong.<br>
<br>
Wangmumei told me that z is called putting on airs. Once when we went to a 
movie, it was better to have a son than a girl. I said, &quot;if you have a girl, you 
can put on airs when you grow up.&quot; She smiled and squeezed my arm hard.<br>
<br>
One night, at the gate of No. 5 middle school nearby, Wang and I were at the 
edge of the fence. She came to cross the scene, and we were still at Z.<br>
<br>
One night, I met a woman named Wang Ling during a dance. After that, I picked up 
my bike in the garage of my unit. Several old colleagues of my unit were there. 
I was a little embarrassed. When we arrived at my house, we talked with Wang 
Ling. She was poor in milk and did not take off her bra. She was not allowed to 
touch. She said that she was a steamed bun, and the other one was flat. I asked 
the difference, and she said that steamed bun Z was comfortable. That night, Z 
went there five times, but the time was not long.<br>
<br>
The next day she brought a girl friend to dinner. She was very beautiful. Wang 
went to have her hair done and served oil. Her friend cooked vegetables at my 
home. I gave them bacon and bones to eat. When the three of us had dinner, I got 
up and said to them, &quot;it&#39;s delicious.&quot; Is to imitate Zhao Benshan&#39;s words.<br>
<br>
When commander Tang and Wang Kesheng came, we went to dance, but when her best 
friend had something to do, she took the initiative to say 88 to us loudly. 
Commander Tang and I danced with Wang Ling one after another for a while.<br>
<br>
Wang Ling told me that my hair would be smooth. I also used oil. At that time, 
my hair was very long, just like the military uniform video. Then we went to the 
restaurant for lunch. We looked in the mirror like four people. She had to pay 
for it.<br>
<br>
Once Wang Ling took a bath in my bathroom. There was a crack under the door. 
Tang and I were looking at each other. We were poor in milk and slim. Tang had a 
girlfriend named Youfei at that time. Tang said Wang Kesheng couldn&#39;t stand it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VI<br>
<br>
Once when the dance floor didn&#39;t start, Wang Ling and I went to the campus of 
No. 5 middle school and sat down for a long talk. She was too thin. I didn&#39;t 
like her. Later, I even hated her. I saw her ID card at home. When dancing, she 
held me. I looked at the beautiful women around me. I didn&#39;t like her anymore.<br>
<br>
Once my junior high school classmate Ju Hongcheng came to Zhenjiang and made an 
appointment with his classmate wangguofang. The three of us went to the hotel 
where he stayed and danced in the Jinlong hotel. He was working in electric 
power. At that time, my hair was very long, just like the military uniform of 
Shenwang. Ju said that he would be afraid of people like me. I just danced with 
wangguofang. Someone called me. It was Wang Ling and her companion. Wang Ling 
asked me, &quot;how many of you?&quot; I said, &quot;mind your business.&quot; It was impolite. It 
was just to show my masculinity in front of my old classmates. I regretted it 
afterwards, but Wang Ling didn&#39;t mind. She still danced with me. After that, she 
took the initiative to go with us. Alas, I&#39;m sorry for her.<br>
<br>
Later, she called the finance department. I wasn&#39;t there. A colleague in the 
finance department was also called Wangling, who also said that she was called 
Duoduo.<br>
<br>
At that time, Xie Xiaodong, a little fresh meat, was quite popular. His 
colleague wangzhengping also said that he looked like Xiaoge, which showed that 
I was not low in appearance:)<br>
<br>
About high school classmate Wang Qun (a girl with a nervous Diary) came to 
Xiaoti for a dance. She worked in Zhenjiang, but did not contact again. It may 
be that I found her home phone number in the yellow page of the number.<br>
<br>
Xulongyun, a high school classmate, also works in Zhenjiang. Let&#39;s go to the 
fifth component factory and come to my office once. He is very capable.<br>
<br>
One morning, my college classmate Li Qing (Taicang, Suzhou) came to my office 
and brought a bad news. He told my classmate Dengjin that she had died (jumped 
from a building) in Shenzhen. I was very sad. She had been in love for four 
years. Now her figure is still very clear in her mind. She is the class flower 
of my class. She is a very beautiful Jiangxi top student. She is the one whose 
score can go up to the north, not me that the Internet philosophy circle said.<br>
<br>
Once, in general, a woman danced with me. She said that she danced once a week. 
I asked her why she didn&#39;t come more. She said: &quot;economic problems.&quot; dancing, 
the ticket money is not enough, which has risen to economic problems. Most dance 
halls in Zhenjiang are free for women, so as to attract wolves:) but large and 
small bodies, because there are many women, women are not free, and the lights 
are bright. Husbands are very relieved that their wives go to large and small 
bodies.<br>
<br>
One night, after dancing, I asked a woman named Xiao Chu to come to my house. 
When she asked for Z, she took off her pants. She held up her pants and twisted 
to prevent me from entering. I was nervous and held out. She said no, I said I 
would shoot. She said yes, and shot outside her. &quot;I cried before I entered the 
door&quot;:) she got up and cleaned up, saying that it would be terrible if she went 
in. Send her a poncho when it rains. The next day, before 8 o&#39;clock, she called 
my unit. Chief Shu answered and said I didn&#39;t come. In fact, I cooked fried rice 
with eggs in the canteen. I brought commander Tang to eat. When he came, he also 
brought him to eat.<br>
<br>
My mother told me that a man came to my unit to kneel down and beg me not to 
contact his wife again. I was not there at that time. I was in the dormitory 
area at No. 20 Jiefang Road. It should be zhangqiuying. Later, I asked commander 
Tang. He said that there was no such thing. If there was, he would hear about 
it.<br>
<br>
On one Sunday afternoon, a woman named Yanqin was invited to take her home to Z. 
she asked for money (some women began to ask for money at that time). I took out 
my pocket and gave her 70 or 80 yuan. She said yes. Z did it once and did it for 
the second time. It was not hard. I took out Yupu Tuan and read it. She said it 
was hard after reading it. Z did it for the second time. Afterwards, she left 
and gave me some rice dumplings in the cart basket. I didn&#39;t want them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VII<br>
<br>
One summer evening, I went to a dance hall in Zhenjiang daily. I saw two women, 
one fat and the other thin. I asked the fat girl to dance. Her name was Xu AI. 
After that, we went to the riverside park for cold drinks. A flower seller came 
to my place. I didn&#39;t buy it. Xu AI wanted me to buy flowers for her. The flower 
seller should not be able to sell them. He said that I gave money casually, but 
I still didn&#39;t buy them.<br>
<br>
It was in 1998, in the era of using BPs, we decided to play later. I asked her 
to pretend to be my junior high school classmate wangguofang and call my wife. 
My wife knew wangguofang. Xu AI found a public telephone nearby and called my 
home. She said, &quot;are you ge Yimin&#39;s wife?&quot; My wife said, &quot;yes,&quot; and Xu AI said, 
&quot;Ge Yimin will come home later tonight.&quot; My wife said, &quot;OK.&quot; my wife believes in 
Wang Guofang and thinks we should go to parties and dance or something.<br>
<br>
After the cold drink, Xu AI and I went to the park to chat. She said that her 
father was a hospital president or something. Of course, I don&#39;t believe it. She 
said that there was a right father-in-law and daughter-in-law. When she went to 
the hospital, his father had a shot and separated.<br>
<br>
Then we went to her rented place and we went to Z. I said, &quot;I want Z2 times. The 
first time is not long.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; she asked I said, &quot;two minutes.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s been 
two minutes,&quot; she said...<br>
<br>
Afterwards, we left each other a copy number. When I went home, she sent me to 
the roadside. We kissed under the street lamp for a long time. There were two 
men standing nearby. It was very late when I got home. I spread a mat to sleep 
in the living room. I couldn&#39;t be calm for a long time. My brother-in-law was 
there and asked me to have an early rest.<br>
<br>
At that time, I was already working in Changzhou. She often tortured me when I 
returned to the town for a weekend on Friday. When I had dinner in the canteen, 
I called back from the office. Sometimes she left and asked the shopkeeper to 
ask me to torture her again.<br>
<br>
She said that her sister-in-law was dancing that day, and her brother was also 
playing outside. A woman in Zhenjiang was attracted to her brother and wanted to 
spend a lot of money for him. Her brother didn&#39;t agree, but she and her 
sister-in-law encouraged her.<br>
<br>
One Saturday night, she took me to her sister&#39;s house for dinner. I bought a lot 
of cooked vegetables. Her brother-in-law also said that it was good to install a 
large ceiling fan. Her brother-in-law was engaged in manufacturing and other 
businesses. But at that time, I installed air conditioners. People&#39;s 
satisfaction is always relative.<br>
<br>
Her two nieces are twins, Fengchang is cute and two years older than my son. She 
decided to take them tomorrow (Sunday) and my son to the commercial summer 
children&#39;s Park.<br>
<br>
The next day, I took my son with me. She took two nieces to the commercial 
summer children&#39;s Park. Five of us went in. The two nieces were very good at 
playing, and they also took my son to play. My son also had a good time. Xu AI 
and I were sitting inside, but there were two buttons in her thick dress. I was 
just like xuepan. &quot;I was afraid Baochai would be seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
One hot day, we were still in her sister-in-law&#39;s rental house.<br>
<br>
I went back to town from Changzhou on Friday and went directly to her house for 
rent. She said that the old landlord watched her take a bath and she scolded. At 
z, she said false pterin, which made me happy, and then said no. She said she 
wanted to try the backcourt. She said it was on the video, but I didn&#39;t agree. 
Then she said it was bad.<br>
<br>
I gave her my gold ring. She said she pawned it. I told my wife I lost my bath.<br>
<br>
When I came back to town from work on Friday, I went to Xu Aina again. My wife 
called manager CAI and asked why I hadn&#39;t come home. Cai tortured me. I said 
that commander Tang was here and he told me to go home. I got a yellow one. Xu 
AI and I took it together. When we got to my door, I went home alone and told my 
wife to go to commander Tang.<br>
<br>

Chapter VIII<br>
<br>
At the end of the 1990s, the shampoo room rose. The hair salon sister washed 
your hair for one hour. I had a dry cleaning in Zhenjiang. It was a hairdresser 
with dry cleaning. The boss also gave me a color photo. It was very beautiful.<br>
<br>
I work in Changzhou Benniu, but in the shampoo center, there is one every 20 
meters, with a hair salon sign, but I don&#39;t have a haircut. I specialize in dry 
shampoo. There is one not far from our company. The landlady&#39;s name is 
guohongmei. She is very plump and beautiful. She looks like a Hong Kong star on 
her nerves. There is also a beauty salon girl named Dongyan.<br>
<br>
I went in and asked the landlady to wash it. After guohongmei washed it, I said 
I would pay you 20 yuan. I went into the inner room (a small bed with a facial 
mask) to talk. She and I went in. I hugged her. She hid and chatted. She turned 
out to be my hometown in Jurong. I was in Jurong North (Dazhuo) and she was in 
Jurong South (Guozhuang).<br>
<br>
Dongyan likes to watch horror movies, but she is also very afraid. When there 
are no guests, she plays them in the hair salon. We sit together. When we get to 
the horror scene, she drills into my arms. She also asked me to sit next to her. 
Otherwise, I would be very happy. When I put on the facial mask, I hugged her, 
and she hid. Dongyan also asked me to bring VCDs to them in Zhenjiang, such as 
Lin Zhixian&#39;s single love song.<br>
<br>
Guohongmei took a walk with me at noon one day. When she came to my office, she 
was so beautiful that she attracted comments from her colleague shazhifeng.<br>
<br>
At that time, I had read the Bible stories, but did not participate in 
Christianity. I asked them to call me Christ, and then bought them newspapers or 
chocolates. Dongyan often called me Christ. Once Guo Hongmei fell down. I bought 
a lot of things to comfort her. Another time, she wanted to go back to her 
hometown. I asked local friends to take her to the station by motorcycle. I 
promised to be the Christ and buy guohongmei a mobile phone. She said that she 
would like me. Later, when I went online in Zhenjiang Internet cafe, she called: 
&quot;buy me something&quot;. I refused her as the Christ.<br>
<br>
I also went to another shampoo room to get along with zhanglanfang. Once I put 
on a facial mask upstairs. I don&#39;t know what she said. She took off her pants, 
proved her innocence and put it on again soon. Some of my colleagues came to me 
that time to make trouble.<br>
<br>
Ni&#39;e, who is with zhanglanfang, is very beautiful. Once I took her shopping. She 
bought a lot in the supermarket. Later, when the two of them left, there came a 
man named Huang Qingchun. I said that you were old and this name was 
inappropriate. She went home and left an address for me. I wrote a letter to 
her. They were from Henan. I asked her to buy a Bible. The landlady was also 
from Henan. She said I would buy it for you, but I bought it at the church in 
the town. Huang Qingchun once told me a few words &quot;1 Corinthians&quot;. I wrote &quot;Miss 
Huang Qingchun received&quot; in my envelope. She replied that she would not write 
Miss Huang next time. By that time, Miss Huang had begun to be stigmatized.<br>
<br>
In Zhenjiang, there is a dance hall at Qingyun gate. In the morning, I met two 
women: wuxiaoxia and Tangyan. I asked wuxiaoxia to dance. They are from Wenzhou, 
Zhejiang Province. Once at noon, we went to Huangshan shopping mall, wuxiaoxia&#39;s 
home, and we wore a Z suit.<br>
<br>
In December2000, our unit was restructured, and I left the provincial 
agricultural means of production. One afternoon, wuxiaoxia and Tangyan and I 
went to the dance hall in the basement of Zhongshan Bridge to dance. When Lao 
Di, I was red pants and long hair. When I was four with wuxiaoxia, I heard 
someone call me. It turned out that it was Xu AI and her sister-in-law. I was 
nostalgic, so I went to them. Xu AI was dissatisfied with Wu Xiaoxia and said 
that she looked like a Hong Kong man wearing a hat.<br>
<br>
After the ballroom was over, I took Xu AI and her sister-in-law to the dashikou 
postal teller machine and took 100 to her sister-in-law and 200 to Xu AI. On the 
second day, Xu AI asked me to go to her apartment in Huangshan. She also had a 
Bible, which was a new version in simplified horizontal format. I used the 
combined version and the traditional vertical format. She took the initiative to 
communicate with me. One afternoon, when I was at home, her sister-in-law called 
me on my mobile phone to ask me out. I refused.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IX<br>
<br>
Once in a dance hall at dashikou, I asked a woman to dance. Her name was 
zhangyanmei. She took the initiative to stick to it, so I invited her. She 
danced a few songs and swallowed four. When we sat down, she got K and vomited. 
I made an appointment to go to my house in the afternoon. She carried a long 
string of keys. She was a warehouse keeper. We were Z.<br>
<br>
Wuxiaoxia and Tangyan are also dancing with me in the morning. They have the 
right to exercise. Once in the afternoon, they took a girl named Lanlan, and the 
four of us were dancing. During the dance, I was very close to the three of 
them. During the song, I sat on the bench, and LAN LAN sat on my leg. She danced 
up and down, attracting others&#39; glances. When it was almost three o&#39;clock, I 
also invited a beautiful young woman to dance. It was a very beautiful day. At 
the end, Lan Lan wanted me to invite them to dinner, but wuxiaoxia stopped her.<br>
<br>
Later, wuxiaoxia left Zhenjiang and went to other places to do small business. 
She lent me 300 yuan. Later, she wanted to pay it back online. I didn&#39;t let her. 
I told her. After I surfed the Internet, I introduced QQ to her. She sent back a 
text message and typed it as PP.<br>
<br>
After Tang Yan returned to Wenzhou, once I was surfing the Internet in an 
Internet cafe. She asked me to charge her mobile phone 100. She is a Zhenjiang 
mobile phone. I charged it, and she always praised me. Later, when she returned 
to Zhenjiang, a girl, Chenglin, was with her.<br>
<br>
Once, I was looking for Tang Yan. She was lying in bed wearing a skirt. I 
touched her shorts. It smelled very bad. I didn&#39;t touch her.<br>
<br>
Chenglin is a young man who likes reading books. She said, &quot;the spring rain is 
continuous. My wife sleeps alone.&quot; let me type a word, and then say, &quot;tell you 
it&#39;s one.&quot; let me say the reason. Before I think about it, she said that spring 
has no day and no husband.<br>
<br>
And Chenglin Z, it was a long time, but she told me that she was bleeding, so I 
had to give it up.<br>
<br>
Later, I asked Cheng Lin to take a taxi to Qinggong. I paid the fare and took 
her to the back of the rehabilitation hospital for fast food. It was very 
affordable. Then I took her to an Internet cafe and taught her to surf the 
Internet. I also registered an account in Yahoo China. We went to Z under the 
canal. At first, I wanted to face each other. She couldn&#39;t say Z well, so she 
went in later.<br>
<br>
In a dance hall at Huli bridge, I met a woman named maxiaoli. When she was 
walking, she said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter if the feelings come.&quot; One Sunday 
afternoon, we were in Z. she was naked and lying in bed. She was a little plump. 
I said to her, &quot;very happy&quot;, T before Z. After that, I showed her on the 
Internet. Someone knocked at the door. I opened the door. It was my son. I asked 
his mother. He said, &quot;at Lao Guo&#39;s house.&quot; It turned out to be watching people 
play mahjong. It was such a coincidence that I let maxiaoli go. Later, my son 
told his mother that I was also dismissed by Wang Guofang.<br>
<br>
When zhangqiuying knew that I was married, she forced me to buy her a big bag of 
candy at Zhongshan shopping mall. I took her to KFC for several times. When I 
danced, she hugged me, but I didn&#39;t like seeing all the beautiful women in the 
hall. I had sex with her at my house for times. After that, I said she was K. 
she said it was dirty now. It was OK to wash it clean. Because she was older 
than me, I joked: &quot;zhangqiuying is old and unruly.&quot; She said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid you 
said that.&quot;<br>
<br>
One afternoon, when I was walking in the street, I suddenly heard someone call 
me &quot;Ge Yimin&quot;. I didn&#39;t recognize her. A woman with a big wavy head was very 
fashionable. After listening to her, I knew it was zhoudongfeng. I took her to 
my house. My son was there. Because he was still young, I asked him to watch 
cartoons in his bedroom. Close the door. Don&#39;t hurry to Z with zhoudongfeng on 
the sofa. At first, my son ran out, and I dared to let him go back to watch TV.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter X<br>
<br>
On Christmas Eve 2000, I went to the gospel church on Daxi road. On the second 
floor, Xu AI also came. But she smoked and came in smelling of smoke. I said she 
was not happy.<br>
<br>
Later, one morning, I took her to my house. I rode a bike and gave her three 
rounds. Before Z, she asked for money, and I was unhappy. I happened to have a 
50 on me. I said I wanted to buy vegetables, but she said something to her. I 
didn&#39;t have Z, so I sent her away and said goodbye.<br>
<br>
One night, when I was a little excited, I went to the No. 1 hair salon in 
Jiefang Bridge to have a haircut and dry shampoo. There was a beautiful and 
enchanting landlady (from Wenzhou), about 40 years old, and two young ladies 
(from Wenzhou and Heilongjiang), in their 20s. I explained my intention. They 
didn&#39;t cut their hair or wash their hair. They asked me to Z. Say 100, I looked 
in my wallet, there were 80, the landlady said it was 80.<br>
<br>
The two young ladies told me how much they would pay for both of them at the 
same time, how much they would pay to the hotel, how much they would pay to your 
home, and how much they would pay to your home. There was a risk that your wife 
might find something.<br>
<br>
I said to the landlady Z, and the landlady said, &quot;it&#39;s an old woman.&quot; Then I got 
up and went inside. I followed her in. There was a big bed in the plastic 
curtain.<br>
<br>
The proprietress took off her pants and lay down. I was T before Z. she took the 
initiative to show x again and kept urging: &quot;hurry up.&quot;...<br>
<br>
When I finished, I took out my wallet and some money. The landlady said, &quot;give 
it to me together.&quot;. He asked me to leave again and said, &quot;you are here. No one 
else dares to come in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many years later, I met a Zhenjiang lady Wan Hong on the Internet, who was much 
older than me. She chatted on QQ and knew Han Qinfen. She asked me who Han 
Qinfen was? It means that I have read nerves and at least 24 sections of the 
book of visions. We made an appointment to open a room. We stayed for 4 hours. 
In the whole afternoon, we chatted three times. We used to be a boss and worked 
in coal. I was selling e-Book nerves on Taobao and asked her to shoot them. She 
said no. just the next day, I had a bad cold. After the Qingming Festival, I 
deleted her QQ.<br>
<br>
In March2001, after I went online, I stopped dancing, because I wanted to write 
about nerves and publicize. I had no time to dance, and the women I knew became 
Internet women.<br>
<br>
Nerve XIV (VII) 3. In 2002, I became the first forum community (Yemei 
community). Dandong girl Han Mei lengxue selflessly helped me and succeeded. She 
also revised the HTML website for me. I have been using it until now. I will 
always be grateful from the bottom of my heart. She was the first time I said 
&quot;it&#39;s nice to have you&quot; to her, really.<br>
<br>
4. The administrator of Hong Kong girls hardcover limited edition used to be 
very speculative. Later, because she didn&#39;t come to the community for a long 
time, she added her section. Since then, she ignored me. Alas.<br>
<br>
（8） 2. A group of Kazakh and Korean girls came to the community to go crazy, 
such as carth, woooo, money, Chen Lin, etc. it was so lively at that time. And I 
am their acknowledged eldest brother.<br>
<br>
3. I fell in love with the Sichuan girl Lijuan (myself). Later, she said that it 
was impossible to be together. This was my third true love, but it was a pity 
for Plato.<br>
<br>
4. XingKong, a girl from Ningbo, is the same administrator as Li Juan. She is 
crazy about posting in the community. I am a little negative about her.<br>
<br>
5. The decent girls Colleen and SA Xue, the woman Lizi, Li Min and the English 
woman Margaret also stayed with me for quite a long time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XI<br>
<br>
In the spring and summer of 2004, shortly after the opening of Baidu Post Bar, I 
applied for God bar master (ID St. yeme) and God bar master (ID plastic, as a 
female number). My purpose is to post to publicize my thoughts. God&#39;s bar has a 
female bar friend with ID &quot;I&quot;, who is a Christian. She posted a post on 
&quot;youzibing&quot; (a famous Christian Book). I refined her. After the interaction, I 
learned that her name was Li Juan, from Deyang, Sichuan, and she was still a 
little girl at that time. We called her &quot;Ben Ben&quot;. She said that at first she 
thought that Saint Jeme was a woman and that plastic was a man, but the result 
was the opposite.<br>
<br>
She wants to be the second bar owner of God bar (one bar can have three big bar 
owners). I taught her to post an application in God bar, and then agreed with 
the &quot;plastic&quot; number. She sent this post link to apply to Baidu administrator. 
It was successful.<br>
<br>
I also invited her to work as an administrator in Yemei community. At that time, 
Yemei also had several administrators, such as the administrator XingKong 
(waiting under the XingKong, Ningbo girl). When she came here, she mainly 
focused on the notebook.<br>
<br>
When chatting on this QQ, she always gave me videos. At that time, I didn&#39;t 
install a camera, she couldn&#39;t see me, and she didn&#39;t mind. On QQ, I let Ben 
choose the relationship: 1. Sister, 2. Confidante, 3. Lover. Ben chose his 
lover.<br>
<br>
At that time, there was an interactive netizen, a young man in Benben, who 
pursued Benben. Benben disagreed. Benben said to me, &quot;if he knew it was you, 
what would he think?&quot; I am a teenager, married and have children.<br>
<br>
I sent a few messages to Benben, that is, God - given marriage, never separate 
and so on, in the name of Jesus. I am not satisfied with what I said. I asked 
her to resend it. She asked me to teach her how to write.<br>
<br>
This book is very beautiful. At that time, I had many pictures of her on my 
computer. I also showed them to swallow Lisan. Lisan said it would be good to 
meet. Later we broke up and I changed my computer. Now I don&#39;t have a picture of 
her. I&#39;m sorry.<br>
<br>
At that time, the SMS capacity was limited, but I always kept her three SMS 
messages I chose. When I send text messages, I always write the text message 
limit full, and the sky says I don&#39;t waste.<br>
<br>
Every night, she chats with Benben QQ. She still goes to Internet cafes and 
takes a bus. Ben really wanted to marry me. At that time, I said I wanted a son. 
She also said, &quot;why doesn&#39;t she (my wife) want children? She isn&#39;t born?&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, Ben Ben&#39;s father got seriously ill. I told her to pray for her father, 
but I obeyed God&#39;s will. When her father died, she used PHS to call me on my 
mobile phone. I didn&#39;t receive it at that time. I thought it was a fixed line 
and didn&#39;t reply. The number of Sichuan PHS is different from that of Jiangsu.<br>
<br>
Ben Ben goes to work at the weather station. The weather service is that 
citizens call to ask about the weather, and they answer. She said in a very 
sweet voice. Once someone called to harass me. She told me that the person said, 
&quot;I want to talk to you about sun B&quot;. She was very angry. I said, &quot;he is not 
aimed at you, he is aimed at customer service.&quot; She thought so.<br>
<br>
She often wears yellow and white pajamas at home (in QQ video). When she saw her 
mother, I said, &quot;say hello to your mother for me.&quot; She said her mother said, 
&quot;welcome to Deyang.&quot;<br>
<br>
I taught the notebook to make a website. It was simply the home page, article 
list page and article page. She was not familiar with them. At that time, there 
was no time limit for surfing the Internet. There was a time limit in January. I 
worked overtime, but I still taught her slowly.<br>
<br>
One night, we talked about my &quot;2019 doomsday&quot;. She particularly objected and 
asked me to stop studying 2019. Of course, I argued and was not happy. The 
person who really loves you commands you, just as Li Min in Wuhan heard me smoke 
later and said, &quot;no smoking.&quot; Later, I asked a QQ friend to say, &quot;you said no 
smoking.&quot; What she said is not as good as Li Min&#39;s &quot;no smoking.&quot; Three words.<br>
<br>
Ben Ben was a true Christian and preached the gospel to Lizi. Lizi didn&#39;t 
believe it, but said Ben Ben was especially sincere.<br>
<br>
I used the drawing software to make an online marriage certificate with Benben. 
According to the format of the marriage certificate and the western wedding 
oath, I pasted photos of both sides, that is, Li Juan and Ge Yimin are married, 
and they are willing to stay together forever no matter whether they are rich or 
poor, healthy or ill in the future. To be declared husband and wife in the name 
of the father, the son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>

Chapter 12<br>
<br>
Nerve XXVII (III) 505. Deception about Yemei and plastic goods<br>
<br>
After I entered Yemei, I found that this is a thoroughly evil cult!<br>
<br>
We all know the main plastic products of Yemei forum, such as Yemei, yexue, 
etc., but the former administrator of Yemei (Li Juan) may not have heard of many 
new comers to Yemei and God&#39;s bar. She is the biggest victim in Yemei&#39;s history.<br>
<br>
Maybe Yemei has blocked all the posts about this at that time. But his crimes 
have affected many innocent people.<br>
<br>
Originally, we only waited for God&#39;s redemption and his repentance, but now it 
seems that the power of yemenism has become too strong to be ignored. When we 
left Yemei, it was just Easter Eve. At that time, Yemei had more than 4000 
members. In a twinkling of an eye, there are now 5000 people. As long as one 
person passes on the idea of this cult to two people, tens of thousands of 
people in the country will be cheated or even injured every year. Since one&#39;s 
own desire has spread to the whole nation, one can&#39;t help but make people angry, 
so I&#39;m going to stand up and expose his tricks.<br>
<br>
The first is the identity of Yemei. Yemei claimed to be a reporter of Xinhua 
news agency. I have to admit that I have not investigated whether this is true 
for the time being. But one day it was proved that he was lying. He said his 
real name was Ge Yimin, and he graduated from Nanjing University. But we did not 
find this name on the list of Nanjing University graduates. Obviously, this is a 
shameful deception of Yemei.<br>
<br>
Moreover, Yemei was already the father of the child, but he was still so mean as 
to deceive the young administrator himself. When I knew the truth, he vowed to 
divorce his wife and marry me. I believed him and began to wait with 
expectation. However, the dream turned into a nightmare, and Yemei later 
confessed to the administrator XingKong, and made advances to the then yemeire 
Pavilion moderator glacier tiannv. Yemei told the girls that she was the only 
one in his heart, and he had no such feelings for others. Later, glacier 
believed it and decided to leave Yemei under pressure. When I asked him to stay, 
the truth finally came out.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know how many people have been cheated by Yemei. This is really a 
shameful act.<br>
<br>
Later, I posted a post on Yemei, asking Yemei, what is God given marriage? &quot;God 
given marriage&quot; was what Yemei said when she told binghe that she wanted to 
marry binghe online and was confident of bringing this marriage into reality. 
There is nothing more despicable than deceiving the feelings of believers under 
the banner of God.<br>
<br>
After that, Yemei never showed up to avoid. Later, Yemei explained that she went 
to interview the veteran soldiers, but the place was remote and had no Internet. 
Faced with such a coincidence, most people began to laugh at Yemei.<br>
<br>
A long time later, Yemei shamefully sent a post to defend herself. The title was 
&quot;I admit I love myself, and I also admit I love the stars&quot;. What a shameless 
beast! What about your wife? What about your children? Why did you say such a 
thing? Did you think of them when you said that?<br>
<br>
Yemei and plastic products are considered worthy of respect. In fact, you are so 
wrong.<br>
<br>
Of course, Yemei&#39;s deception is far more than what I said, but because of the 
limited time, I will talk about plastic products.<br>
<br>
Plastic products are said to be people who are familiar with Yemei. In fact, 
they are familiar with a person.<br>
<br>
Last year, we saw a news on the website about the death of a girl, and the 
portrait of the father in the photo is the photo uploaded by plastic products in 
Yemei! So we went to find the plastic, only to find that the plastic was still 
there, and the beauty photo was not her at all! But hasn&#39;t yemme seen anything 
plastic? Hasn&#39;t she? Then one day when we were surfing the Internet, we found 
that Yemei and plastic products used the same IP. How did this happen? Yemei 
didn&#39;t say this at that time. Until we all knew it, she explained that at that 
time, they were all surfing the Internet in a university, and the plastic 
product was sitting on the machine next to him.<br>
<br>
People are all around. Why do you upload fake photos?<br>
<br>
Among the four beauties in Yemei in 2004, plastic products had no tickets. I 
think it was to make the four beauties work better for Yemei. Plastic products, 
whether elected or not, will try their best to work for Yemei.<br>
<br>
Excuse me, have you seen the plastic product? Any of you have met, can you tell 
me?<br>
<br>
But the truth is very simple, but because it is disgusting, we have never said 
that plastic and Yemei are actually the same person!<br>
<br>
We suspect that Yemei is not only dressed up as a plastic product, but now there 
is no way to verify it. But why does yexue protect Yemei so much? Is it really 
because he was young and ignorant and his brother Yemei was so kind to her? 
Or...... Moreover, yexue&#39;s QQ has never been on, so there is no grade to talk 
about. And QQ is also an important way for Yemei to attract members, but why 
don&#39;t the main force like yexue go on QQ?<br>
<br>
It is much more interesting to play others than to play yourself, but after all, 
it is ignorance of the public and hurts too many people.<br>
<br>
I wrote these words, hoping to alert all members of Yemei who were cheated, and 
all innocent people of God. Perhaps, Yemei&#39;s influence and destructive power 
have affected the whole nation. Perhaps his influence is far greater than I 
imagined.<br>
<br>
May God redeem our nation. In the holy name of Jesus Christ, Amen!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
》This is the post of the glacier goddess, but I know that the editor of this 
book has added content, because only this book calls Jesus Christ. At that time, 
I asked her to apply for Jesus bar, but she applied for Jesus bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to keep people in the community, I also made online marriage 
certificates for many girls, that is, I changed Li Juan into their names and 
photos, such as XingKong, glacier tiannv (liangxiaowen), Wanqing, and the woman 
Lizi (Lizi didn&#39;t admit to Benben afterwards, but still stayed in Yemei).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, at the time of the incident, I was ill and hospitalized (mental 
hospital:), unable to deal with the crisis in time. When I was hospitalized, 
they made an appointment to leave Yemei and opened their own forum. Lizi is 
still in Yemei. She doesn&#39;t admit to having an online marriage certificate. She 
is much older than me. XingKong is still posting on Yemei. XingKong has posted 
on their forum. I blame her for not posting on Yemei.<br>
<br>
The administrator of my notebook kept it for a long time, and she repeatedly 
asked me to cancel it. Her post &quot;what is a god given marriage?&quot;, When I saw it, 
it had been edited by her. It&#39;s a pity that I didn&#39;t see the content.<br>
<br>

I used the free space to open a forum &quot;anti Yemei alliance&quot;. The book came back 
and asked the forum owner (actually me, reverse propaganda) for the QQ number.<br>

Later, when she contacted Benben on QQ, she said that it was impossible to be 
together.<br>

Later, I saw Benben&#39;s post in the post bar:<br>

Many years later, in 2004, I fell in love with an Internet girl, Lijuan, from 
Deyang, Sichuan. I met Baidu tieba and became a Yemei community administrator. 
At first, I just thought of her as a little sister. She wanted to be my lover 
and send messages to each other to express her love. Both sides had sincerely 
paid. In order to stay in the community, I also confessed to others. Li Juan 
found out that I was ill and hospitalized. Everything was irreparable. After 
breaking up, she said the reason was that it was impossible to be together. I 
really love her. I often recall that she gave me videos as soon as I chatted on 
QQ. I was moved inexplicably.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 24 64. Li Juan: (1) I would like to. (2) Yemei is popularity.<br>

(when falling in love with Ben Ben, she often plays Faye Wong&#39;s &quot;I do&quot;, 
indicating that she doesn&#39;t mind my age, being married and having children.)<br>

girls!!!<br>
<br>
Li Juan, glacier goddess, XingKong, etc., how many things have you done to them? 
Did you tell everyone that you only love her? Have you ever thought about your 
wife? Where are your children? Did you think of them when you said that? Why did 
you say that to them? I know a lot of what you say are lies! You didn&#39;t graduate 
from Nanjing University! Because you are not on the list of graduates. I know, 
this is your privacy, but don&#39;t hurt the feelings of those girls!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (3) 605. Ge Yimin fell in love with Li Juan, a Sichuan girl, when he

》Liangxiaowen (tiannv of glacier): (about the deception of Yemei and plastic 
products), many years ago, some people still remember that after all these years 
of laughing, it was still BS Yemei song million people. Haha, the world joked 
that Bush also read song million people! Such a thick skin can persist for so 
many years! Cow!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
However, I didn&#39;t cheat Benben&#39;s feelings. I was also sincere. Of course, I 
would like to marry her. However, before I succeed, I don&#39;t deserve her. In her 
words, &quot;it&#39;s impossible to be together.&quot; But I have to be successful for a long 
time. Until today, I am 52 years old, but I still haven&#39;t succeeded, and Benben 
is about 36 years old. Sigh!!!<br>

<br>
During the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the PHS I typed was used by her mother. 
I said, &quot;I&#39;m Li Juan&#39;s net friend. Is she OK?&quot; Her mother said, &quot;Li Juan, OK.&quot; 
Later, Lizi said that Benben had participated in the disaster relief. She was 
from Deyang, Sichuan.<br>
<br>
The three true love I have admitted so far: Xuqian (secret love in high school), 
hanqinfen (secret love in college, even though I have contacts), Benben (online 
love at work), are all recorded in my mind. My wife and real girlfriend Wang 
Rong are not included. How can I say that I cheated Benben&#39;s feelings?<br>
<br>
I met Li Min, a Wuhan woman, whose QQ name is Hui she. She was born in 1972 and 
is a kindergarten teacher. When I was QQ video, she was very young, just like a 
girl. She said that others called her non mainstream. Every time she opened the 
video, she turned it off after opening it for a while, so that when I typed, she 
turned it off and couldn&#39;t take a good look at her.<br>
<br>
I said Zhenjiang, Wuhan. (Zimei, a friend of tieba, is also from Wuhan. She said 
that our two cities are a pair.) Not far. There are many bullet trains. I came 
to see you. Li Min was very happy. I said, &quot;what shall we do when we meet?&quot; She 
said, &quot;Z love, are you still Z love?&quot;<br>
<br>
At the same time, we contacted QQ on MySpace. One night, I told her that I was 
offline, but MySpace was offline and was online for dozens of minutes. Li Min 
thought I was online and ignored her, so she was very angry.<br>
<br>
Li Min also did public welfare, subsidized children in mountainous areas to go 
to school, and sent me live photos. At that time, I set up a &quot;merit box&quot; 
(offering support) in Shenwang, but no one offered it (so far, I have received 
Zhu huaibing&#39;s 20 yuan contribution). I wanted Li Min to make a good start and 
let her offer 50 yuan. She said, &quot;my sponsorship depends on people.&quot; Her meaning 
is that I don&#39;t need sponsorship. I misunderstood her meaning and thought that I 
was a bad person, so I deleted her QQ.<br>
<br>
Later, on a foreign dating website (in Chinese), I sent a mass message to ask 
women to add my QQ to pull people to laishen.com. However, it was different from 
pulling people on dating websites such as Yahoo a few years ago, and the effect 
was not good.<br>
<br>
One day, I received a message on this dating website: &quot;no! You have forgotten 
me.&quot; When I looked at the photos, the winter clothes photos were very beautiful. 
It turned out to be Li Min, because when I sent messages, I didn&#39;t look at the 
women&#39;s information. I selected women, copied the good news, and sent them in 
groups one by one.<br>
<br>
I dare to keep in touch with Li Min and ask her to add my QQ or give me my QQ 
number. She doesn&#39;t give it. I send messages on the dating website again and 
again, saying that if the dating website is closed, we will lose contact again. 
Anyway, two days later, she added my QQ.<br>
<br>
We can chat on QQ again. Talking about the past, she said, &quot;when we were good.&quot; 
She also said, &quot;would you like to buy me a diamond ring customized by I do for a 
lifetime?&quot; Of course I said I would, but I have no money:)<br>
<br>
Later, his father became seriously ill and thin. He said it was related to 
smoking. Knowing that I smoked, Li Min said, &quot;no smoking.&quot; She commands me, I am 
very happy, because love a person, will command him. Later, I asked a netizen to 
tell me that I was not allowed to smoke. What she said was not as good as Li 
Min&#39;s &quot;no smoking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, my old qq46377923 was blocked because I scolded someone in my QQ 
group. This time, I learned to write down Li Min&#39;s QQ number in my notebook, but 
when I added her with my new qq50914333, she set the question &quot;what is my mobile 
phone number?&quot; I have no answer, can not add her, lost contact again.<br>
<br>
During the COVID-19 in Wuhan, I couldn&#39;t get in touch with Li min. how is she 
now? Very much!!!<br>
<br>

me for being amorous, men and women are always just two parallel lines that can 
not be crossed.<br>
<br>
We really can&#39;t go back. I have been abandoned by you. You really hurt me 
deeply. I don&#39;t want to be hurt again.<br>
<br>
We can&#39;t keep up with each other.<br>

Our lifestyles are different. We don&#39;t understand what you do. You only have

After Benben left Yemei, a girl named huangjingbo (laughing at life) came to the 
community. She worked as a technician in Shenzhen. Her hometown is Taiwan. She 
is very beautiful and young. She became my righteous sister and became a 
community administrator instead of Benben. QQ interacted with the community at 
night, and SMS interacted during the day. At that time, there was no mobile QQ, 
around 2006.<br>

Nerve 27 (III) 139. Several mobile phone messages from a Gehua (huangjingbo) 
suspected of worshipping lotus root<br>
<br>
(1) A socialist country is a policy under the leadership of Marxism, Mao Zedong 
Thought and Deng Xiaoping theory. Can Ge Ge Ge&#39;s values of the basic Communist 
alliance conflict with it? Of course not! This is a socialist country. Ge Ge&#39;s 
values certainly have foresight. A new idea can be promoted. First of all, the 
old idea must be overthrown. As a result, war will inevitably be involved. Is it 
true that the third world war will be celebrated just like Hitler? Oh! The 
singer&#39;s ambition is really big, but the ending must be good? If you have 100% 
confidence, Yimei will support you! Together, we will promote the values of song 
Yimin.<br>
<br>
(2) , Ge Ge Ge and Yi Mei will always support you, and peaceful harmony will 
export your Communist values. Maybe you can break the smoke of war that you have 
experienced in the history of changing dynasties. Perhaps, you can surpass all 
schools of thought and form a new idea in the recent time... On a brilliant day 
of singing, we swam around the world...<br>
<br>
(3) Ah, Little Buddha sister is not a God. Little Buddha sister will eventually 
die. Ge Ge is the spokesman of God. God gives you eternal life... One day, 
Little Buddha will still leave you. Therefore, Ge Ge wants the world to 
understand you and let the world believe in Ge Yimin!<br>
<br>
(4) Ah! I am an angel, the queen of Gehua under geyimin international, Gehua 
Q...<br>
<br>
(5) Yi Mei understands that Ge Ge is the spokesman of God. Ge Ge is ambitious. 
Ge Ge&#39;s ideal is to unify the world. Ge Ge belongs to the world. Yi Mei can&#39;t be 
selfish. Ge Ge can understand Yi Mei&#39;s heart. Yi Mei is satisfied. Yi Mei has a 
heaven in her heart. She will always remember her brother...<br>

Yi wants you to promise that one day, angels and prophets will join hands with 
tourists...<br>
<br>
2. Thank you Ge Ge for making a promise for Yimei! Yi Mei understands that Yi 
Mei won&#39;t embarrass Ge anymore... Yimei hopes that Ge Ge will succeed soon! If 
God doesn&#39;t give us fate, don&#39;t forget that there was a passer-by who passed you 
by in a hurry. She is Ge Hua Q. The success of Ge Ge Ge is the greatest 
happiness of Ge Hua q!<br>

Huangjingbo calls me a prophet and calls himself an angel. The angels and 
prophets should be together:) although she is a righteous sister, she is also in 
online love. I have sent her a desert spring and a Bible (small version of Hong 
Kong Version). I wonder if she can receive the Bible? Later, she was busy with 
her work and lost her mind. Finally, she still left me a message: &quot;when the song 
is brilliant, I will travel with you naturally.&quot;<br>

Nerve 27 (III) 512. 4. About the British Federation of geyimin international.<br>
<br>
A ghost widow is fascinated by your yellow and frivolous sentence &quot;my wife&quot;. She 
doesn&#39;t know any Chinese characters and hasn&#39;t touched the surface of the song 
Yimin doctrine, but she hypes the song Yimin doctrine in foreign countries. What 
are dozens of people? What about hundreds of people? Just lend you a brand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I met an English woman Margaret at the Asian Dating Center Stephenson (the 
so-called Ge Hua 24 in Ge Hua book), who is several years older than me, is from 
Manchester, England.<br>
<br>
I was very straightforward. The first email said, &quot;I love you&quot;. She replied in a 
friendly way. I said &quot;my wife&quot; at the beginning of my next email. After several 
emails, I always said &quot;my wife&quot; at the beginning. When I communicated with a 
foreign woman, I said &quot;I love you&quot; for the first time, so that a foreign woman 
said: &quot;you say I love you, just like you say hello&quot;.<br>
<br>
Once I wrote &quot;my wife is poor&quot;, which was written as &quot;my wife is poor&quot;. My 
brother-in-law was there and changed it.<br>
<br>
Margaret sent me a large package of gifts, two silver bracelets to my niece, a 
fine gold necklace to my mother-in-law, gold rings, fine gold bracelets, and so 
on. She also sent me a Manchester United Poster (including Beckham), which I 
posted in my bedroom. I also took the jewelry to the gold shop to identify it. 
The salesperson said it was worthless. Maybe she was afraid that I might steal 
it to sell the stolen goods. She didn&#39;t look at it carefully.<br>
<br>
I returned a gift. I spent 10 yuan to buy a ring at the manna mall, and sent a 
photo of my red pants (in Jiaoshan, Zhenjiang) and a photo of my son&#39;s 
Kindergarten (as a child photo of me). I put a 50 cent note in the box. The 
female postal staff checked it and refused to send 50 cents. Marguerite received 
my photo, scanned it in the library and gave it to me electronically, so I 
uploaded it online.<br>
<br>
Marguerite also sent me some photos. They were not beautiful. One photo was OK. 
It was a middle-aged woman. She divorced and was with her son. Once she took a 
pornographic photo and sent it to me, saying, &quot;very very sexy&quot;. I looked at it, 
but it was not good-looking and could not see clearly.<br>
<br>
I have been communicating with Marguerite for several months. My English is too 
poor. I want Google translate to read her email, but she may not understand what 
I wrote.<br>
<br>
We also talked about pornography. She said, &quot;the last man&#39;s milk for the 
woman.&quot;.<br>
<br>
She once sent me the wrong e-mail and sent me the e-mail she gave others. I 
googled and translated it. It seemed that she asked the other party for money or 
something.<br>

I learned word, Excel and Internet knowledge. In March, I began to surf the 
Internet in Internet cafes.<br>
<br>
First, I applied for an e-mail address. On Sohu, I typed &quot;Christ&quot; in English as 
my user name. At that time, when I was called Christ, I filled in Christian and 
it was occupied. The system recommended christ3301. It&#39;s amazing. 33301 is the 
corresponding number of the original &quot;total salary&quot;, &quot;Jinsui credit card&quot;, 
&quot;postal green card&quot; and &quot;medical record&quot;. These numbers are highly consistent, 
and I have already recorded them in my notebook. When filling in the nickname, I 
filled in &quot;Christ&quot; and was occupied. The recommended name is &quot;Christ 3301&quot; and 
3301 again. It&#39;s amazing.<br>
<br>
At that time, there were three major events on the Internet: &quot;watching news, 
sending e-mail, and chatting&quot;. QQ (called OICQ at that time) had become popular. 
I applied for a qq46377923, but portal websites all had &quot;chat rooms&quot; to chat in 
a room at any time, usually with strangers. Remember that in Sohu chat room, I 
said I was Christ, and a Nanjing bride named Millennium bride immediately said 
&quot;yes&quot;?<br>
<br>
I am interested in the forum because I want to publish articles and ideas. At 
that time, there were three major portals (Sina, Sohu and Netease), three small 
portals (263, Tom and fm365), and Yitang was also very popular. It registered a 
user name with an email and an e-mail Office (163.net, which was later acquired 
by Tom). I have a common user name &quot;god33cn&quot;. 3 is my lucky number, and 7.<br>
<br>
There are also special forum websites, such as Tianya, Kaidi, maopu, Xici, Xilu, 
etc.<br>
<br>
Yahoo China is also a portal and very popular. At that time, Yahoo had an MZ 
with messages, such as China.<br>
<br>
Yahoo China has a club and an electronic tribe, which is equivalent to a self 
built forum. I have set up one for each. I have no teachers and I have 
registered about 10 trumpets to serve as a facade. Because netizens like places 
with many people, you are the only one in your forum, and no one else will come.<br>
<br>
The user name and password were first recorded on my business card. Later, more 
and more websites were registered. If I could not write down the business card, 
I would write it down on paper.<br>
<br>
I know that word can be copied and pasted. I don&#39;t know that different websites 
(forums) can also copy and paste. All of them are an article written on paper at 
home, and then go to the Internet bar to type in one forum and another forum. 
It&#39;s a big network embarrassment.<br>
<br>
Soon, I got an official online name &quot;St. Jeme&quot;, St.: holy: Yahweh, Jesus may: 
the last Greek letter Omega Omega. The last Messenger of God.<br>
<br>
At that time, the personal home page was very popular (personal websites, portal 
websites provided free secondary and tertiary domain names and spaces). In 
April, I built a personal home page in Sohu, called &quot;the gospel of St. Jeme&quot;, 
and put my articles on it. At the beginning, I often wrote them, and the forum 
posted them on the website. I posted one article, and a website posted three 
sections. Of course, it was the intention of advertising. Later, Baidu Post Bar 
brushed the screen. This is the next story.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter II<br>
<br>
On May 1, when I returned to my hometown in Jurong, the number of visits to 
Sohu&#39;s personal home page was more than 100. It was only more than ten days. I 
also told my mother. At that time, I thought that there would be 10 women and 1 
beautiful woman among 100 visitors. In July, a personal home page was built in 
Yahoo global village, as well as an electronic tribe and club.<br>
<br>
At that time, the forum was in vogue. I wanted to build a personal forum and be 
the moderator myself. I posted a consultation on Sina forum. There was a reply 
from a prodigal son about &quot;passion BBS&quot; and posted a website. This is a forum 
website built by myself. It is a bbs3000 program (CGI). I built a forum called 
&quot;St. JEME Gospel&quot; and became the moderator myself. In September, it established 
the Doric personal homepage (myrice, which was already part of Lycos China at 
that time).<br>
<br>
Of course, the contents of the three home pages are the same, that is, the 
mirror station. Since 2001, I have been building a mirror station widely. Of 
course, the purpose is to promote and spread my articles and information. The 
space of Sohu and Yahoo global village is 100m. FTP uploading is very 
convenient. Myrice only has 20m, but I don&#39;t have many articles. It&#39;s enough. 
It&#39;s Web uploading.<br>
<br>
My articles mainly focus on Christianity and the Bible, and I have been on many 
Christian forums, such as the &quot;St. Paul&#39;s Church&quot; in the Western ancestral 
temple, the &quot;wepary.net&quot; (all run by an) and the corresponding religious 
sections of the portal. At the back of each post, I attached my yahoo e-tribe 
and club website, and later the moderator of St. Paul&#39;s church, Meng en, asked 
me to delete the link, otherwise I would delete the post.<br>
<br>
A man from Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, saw my article and introduced me to the 
&quot;Jehovah&#39;s Witness&quot;. He communicated with me by mail for many times and sent me 
some magazines. Many of Yezheng&#39;s views were the same as mine. These magazines 
also provided me with information for writing articles. Later, some post bar 
netizens pointed out that: (nerve 27 (II) 119. R Zhen a Zhen: Ge Yimin, you have 
this doctrine in the United States. Yezheng, Christian communism.)<br>
<br>
The webmaster of Haoqing BBS, we call him the leader of the alliance, and they 
sometimes call him our leader. There is a girl Jane and I have a very good 
relationship. We interact in the forum. We often open several posts on the 
computer, reply to one post, reply to the next post, and constantly refresh the 
posts. She is a personnel officer of a Hong Kong funded enterprise in Foshan, 
Guangdong. She is often online, and even some netizens ask her whether she is an 
Internet cafe network manager.<br>
<br>
The league leader, swallow Lisan, is a lawyer and Cantonese. At the beginning, 
he also asked me about the &quot;nerves 1. He was young. He dreamed that he was lying 
in the open space in front of the house, and a UFO was hovering near his head. 
For a long time, his body could not move, and he had no power. He could only 
look at the UFO. He was a little scared, and he wanted to shoot the UFO with a 
stone. He felt that it would fall on his body, and there was a strong light 
shining on me, giving me ability.&quot;, Say whether l also has light or not. I say I 
am a strange dream.<br>
<br>
Many people have their own version, and the prodigal son has his own version. 
There is a &quot;bingbingyan&quot; who is his deputy. There was a &quot;Silk Road Flower Rain&quot; 
version. At first, she also posted several posts. Later, she didn&#39;t come for a 
long time. Lisan said, &quot;three days of fragrance in the new shit VAT.&quot; As the 
Cantonese saying goes, most of them are Cantonese.<br>
<br>
There is a picture posted by &quot;morning and evening&quot; that is very beautiful. I 
praise her for her beauty. In addition, when others praise me, I promise. They 
laugh at me: &quot;Saint Jeme, believe what others say.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are many people in my e-tribe and club. There is zhangxianzhong, whose 
name is zhangguotang. He is 12 years older than me and calls himself Christ. He 
left me a message at St. Paul&#39;s church, saying to follow him and create a new 
situation in China. I rejected him as independent. He also posted posts in my 
e-tribe and club to publicize him. Later, he left a message on my website as a 
tourist, saying that my website has divinity. I asked him where the divinity is. 
He actually meant that the electronic tribe in the link of my website had his 
articles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter III<br>
<br>
20020227, I registered the international domain name yemei Net (now invalid, 
because com has been registered, and net has been registered), and Yemei network 
has been established. At that time, many personal home page webmasters began to 
register international domain names, and then the website marked &quot;this site&#39;s 
international domain name * * *&quot;.<br>
<br>
I decided to build my own official forum community. Bbs3000 was popular at that 
time, but I downloaded the program and couldn&#39;t install it, so I posted a post 
on the official forum of the program for help.<br>
<br>
Soon, a female netizen named &quot;Hanmei lengxue&quot; (Dandong girl) contacted me with a 
reply. We added a QQ friend. She saw that I didn&#39;t understand the program at 
all. She asked me to give her a space FTP account. It wasn&#39;t long. She told me: 
&quot;you can use the Forum&quot;. I opened it and it was built. It is called Yemei 
community. (PS later saw that her name was Qi yuanchan. I don&#39;t know whether it 
was true or not.)<br>
<br>
Hanmei and lengxue revised the HTML website for me. The framework has been used 
so far, and I will always be grateful from the bottom of my heart. She was the 
first time I said &quot;it&#39;s nice to have you&quot; to her, really.<br>
<br>
At that time, there was no blog post bar, microblog short video live broadcast, 
and many people played forums. There were many people in general personal 
forums, and there were also many people in Yemei community.<br>
<br>
At that time, there were many free dating websites, such as Yahoo. I copied and 
pasted a paragraph. When I saw a woman on it, I sent it to Yemei, such as 
Wanqing.<br>
<br>
I have also built n waistcoats without a teacher. Each waistcoat defines 
personal settings, such as Shu Qi (straightforward), plastic products 
(spokesperson), Millennium Bride (key and eldest sister), maxiaoli (naughty), 
Mona Lisa (Orthodox) and Fei Jialing (social gospel). One is to avoid confusion, 
and the other is to give netizens an independent personality.<br>
<br>
I added the administrator Hanmei (in fact, she added it herself to debug the 
community program for me) and the Deputy webmaster of the website. She wanted to 
be a guest. I said that the Deputy webmaster is your website. Of course, she 
also has her own website &quot;Jiang Xue Xuan Shuang Chinese website&quot;. I also posted 
on her forum for interaction.<br>
<br>
A Hong Kong girl first saw my articles in other forums. I mainly wrote about 
Christianity. There was an anti base post. She saw it and wanted me to refute 
it. I said I didn&#39;t care and invited her to be a Yemei administrator. Her name 
is &quot;hardcover limited edition&quot;. At first, she posted a lot of posts. I opened a 
section &quot;happiness store&quot; for her, which is actually an emotional section.<br>
<br>
Bbs3000 forum is a forum that can be opened by netizens. At first, I didn&#39;t want 
others to open the forum. I was afraid that others would post indiscriminately. 
I also asked how to prohibit it in the program forum. Netizens replied to turn 
off the opening function.<br>
<br>
Later, in order to be popular, Yemei opened the opening function. A large number 
of Korean and Korean girls came to the community to open the version. First, 
woooo opened a version of &quot;JTL&quot;, a Korean wave combination, and then cath opened 
a version of &quot;hot&quot;... As a result, three pages were opened. They were really 
crazy. There were also money, Chen Lin, etc. they were so busy at that time. I 
was their recognized big brother.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IV<br>
<br>
Most of them are little girls, but few are little boys. They call themselves the 
57th ethnic group in China, &quot;the Kazak and Korean.&quot; The JTL &#39;group consists of 
three people, separated from the&#39; hot &#39;group of five. The singing group dances 
while singing, and they are all small fresh meat. Money&#39;s user name comes from 
money yuan, a member of the hot group. She has opened the section &quot;hahan hot 
Literature Museum&quot;. In order to keep the little girl, I was 33 years old at that 
time, and I also called myself ha Han:) Chen Lin and others opened other 
sections, with dozens of sections. I also registered &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;Kazak and Korean&quot;, 
&quot;Korean wave&quot; and other IDS to join the fun and interact with little girls.<br>
<br>
I like Shu Qi because she is very similar to me (wild, childish, but full of 
Femininity), Opened the Shuqi section. At that time, I was also the moderator of 
Shu Qi, a star website. Someone sent me the first time I met Shu Qi. I turned to 
Yemei without posting. She found it and replied that I had stolen her first 
time.<br>
<br>
I made friends in Asia and met an English woman, Margaret Stephenson (the 
so-called Ge Hua 24 in Ge Hua book), who is several years older than me, is from 
Manchester, England. After several e-mails, I always said &quot;my wife&quot; at the 
beginning. When I exchanged e-mails with a foreign woman, I said &quot;I love you&quot; 
for the first time, so that a foreign woman said: &quot;you say I love you, just like 
you say hello&quot;.<br>
<br>
Margaret sent me a large package of gifts, two silver bracelets to my niece, a 
fine gold necklace to my mother-in-law, gold rings, fine gold bracelets, and so 
on. She also sent me a Manchester United Poster (including Beckham), which I 
posted in my bedroom. I also took the jewelry to the gold shop to identify it. 
The salesperson said it was worthless. Maybe she was afraid that I might steal 
it to sell the stolen goods. She didn&#39;t look at it carefully.<br>
<br>
I returned a gift. I spent 10 yuan to buy a ring at the manna mall, and sent a 
photo of my red pants (in Jiaoshan, Zhenjiang) and a photo of my son&#39;s 
Kindergarten (as a child photo of me). I put a 50 cent note in the box. The 
female postal staff checked it and refused to send 50 cents. Marguerite received 
my photo, scanned it in the library and gave it to me electronically, so I 
uploaded it online.<br>
<br>
I posted a post on a historical section of sina. Because it was a Christian 
Post, a netizen objected to me and argued several times. He said that I was the 
33rd son of God in China. My user name was god33cn. He said that Christians were 
inferior. But when he couldn&#39;t argue with me, he went to see the priest St. John 
(member of the Chinese people&#39;s Political Consultative Conference) in Beijing. 
The priest objected to my country&#39;s era and said it was still the era of the 
Holy Spirit. If he was awarded to Bora, he refuted me. He also registered his 
&quot;God&#39;s father&quot; account, so that a female netizen said that he was arrogant and 
dark. He said that in the history section, I posted a religious post. The female 
netizen said, &quot;doesn&#39;t religion belong to history?&quot;<br>
<br>
I posted a post on the Chinanet forum. The female moderator asked me to explain 
&quot;sin&quot; and &quot;death&quot;. At that time, I replied according to common sense. She 
ridiculed me for not understanding. Christian sin was &quot;out of purpose&quot; (not 
reaching God&#39;s goal), and death was &quot;isolation&quot; (being isolated from God). A 
netizen refuted her, saying that what she thought was right.<br>
<br>
Of course, Internet Christians say I am heretical, and politely say I am ultra 
extreme. There was an Internet cafe where Adam ate forbidden fruit. The old man 
of the Internet cafe saw me typing and said that the reactionary would not let 
me send it. I refuted him. His son also said that he was an ordinary Christian 
article, so I sent it to my Sohu personal homepage.<br>
<br>
Fm365 has an alternative paradise section. I often post, and the moderator often 
refines. He asked me to reply to other people&#39;s posts. I replied several times, 
but I have to write articles, publicize, and build a website. I really don&#39;t 
have time to read other people&#39;s Posts and reply to other people&#39;s posts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter V<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s talk about Chinese little girls here. Because the objects of Kazakhstan 
and Korea are all men&#39;s groups, the &quot;Kazakhstan and Korea&quot; are all little girls 
who are easy to understand. In 2005, super girls rose. During the discussion at 
the Yemen forum, I said that the consumption of men is high. Chasing super girls 
is hot. Kelan, the moderator of Yemen re Museum, told me that chasing super 
girls is a little girl, which violates the &quot;same sex repels and opposite sex 
attracts&quot; and is hard to understand. When fast men rose, those who chased fast 
men were all little girls. Of course, those who chased fast women were still 
little girls. Why are there so many little girls in China.<br>
<br>
Because there are many combinations between Kazakhstan and Korea, the forum 
needs to be divided into special sections. The newly opened sections are in the 
back, and I can&#39;t distinguish between the various combinations. They are very 
strange that I haven&#39;t put the newly opened sections in the appropriate 
combinations. They tell the new owners why your version is not in the &quot;hot&quot; 
section. I see that it should be placed in the right place.<br>
<br>
After that, Yemei changed from bbs3000 to Leiao. It is also a CGI program. The 
Leiao page is beautiful. The webmaster is called the forum master, which is very 
popular. The space merchant (Shanghai) asked the Forum (Interactive) to file and 
closed the forum. I thought it was the telecom filing. When I went to the 
Telecom Bureau, the telecom bureau did not prepare it at all. What should I do 
if the forum has anti gravity posts? I said it must be deleted within 2 days, 
that is, the stationmaster will conduct the last line patrol within 2 days. I 
asked the space merchant again. It was the Bureau of industry and information 
technology. I called the Provincial Bureau of industry and information 
technology and said that I could not prepare. I said that the forum should be 
open. He said that he would not let you talk nonsense. PS later filed with the 
Ministry of industry and information technology directly at the space commerce 
office.<br>
<br>
I had to find a free space abroad to open a forum. I thought it was good. I 
introduced the space at the Leiao official altar, and the official altar was 
selling space. Of course, I didn&#39;t want to see my posts. I asked why I always 
recommended this space. I am very familiar with this fashion forum program and 
have installed it for others, that is, the free space I introduced.<br>
<br>
As the 2-year space expires, the attached yemei I abandoned it because com was 
good, but Yemei was registered. I registered jemei in a space merchant in 
Shenzhen (introduced by swallow Lisan of the French Open Forum) Com (has been 
abandoned, because jemei is not good for Yemei), bought a host, and made Yemei 
community with the mobile network forum program (ASP).<br>
<br>
Reopen the Leiao forum in Yemei community. Because the first moderator of the 
&quot;myth&quot; forum has not registered in the new community, I added moderator Chen 
Lin, who was angry and asked outside that her version had been robbed by others. 
The little girls helped me clarify that you have not registered and do not have 
a user name. How can you add the first moderator?.<br>
<br>
I add the Hong Kong girls hardcover limited edition as the administrator. Her 
section is &quot;happiness store&quot; and I call it &quot;happiness store owner&quot;. Money Yuan 
thinks she is late and has an opinion about her. The owner Posts 1, 2, 3 and 4 
rebuttals. He thinks he is an old Yemei administrator. Money yuan is very 
disgusted and says that Hong Kong women are something.<br>
<br>
It was suggested that Yemei set up a QQ group. It happened that money yuan had 
an empty QQ group, so they took it out for use. I pulled people into the group. 
Dinglan, a Zhejiang QQ friend who was older than me, thought I was the group 
leader. The message for applying to join the group was &quot;husband, I&#39;m here&quot;. 
Money yuan was very angry. It happened that another Tanyou had a group of bubble 
gum. I decided to give up money yuan&#39;s group, let Tanyou add more bubble gum to 
the group, and told money yuan that she was even more angry, saying that I made 
her very uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
Hardcover limited edition used to be very speculative. We were both Christians. 
She praised that I knew Bible better than her. Later, she ignored me because she 
didn&#39;t come to the community for a long time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VI<br>
<br>
From my Internet experience, early netizens had high quality, because there were 
certain conditions for Internet access, mainly urban cultural people.<br>
<br>
Yemei.com and Yemei community were established in 2004. The webmaster (I) set up 
a forum and invited netizens to be the moderator. I mainly pull people to be the 
moderator in the dating network, such as Kelan, Lizi, Wanqing, lollipop, Wantan, 
money, SA Xue, Tiantian amusement, Tianya Xintai, and the later administrators 
(Benben and Lijuan) and XingKong.<br>
<br>
(nerve 14 (8) 3. Fell in love with Sichuan girl Lijuan (herself), and later she 
said that it was impossible to be together. This was my third true love, but it 
was a pity for Plato.<br>
<br>
4. XingKong, a girl from Ningbo, is the same administrator as Li Juan. She is 
crazy about posting in the community. I am a little negative about her.<br>
<br>
5. The decent girls Kelan and SA Xue, the woman Lizi, Li Min and the English 
woman Margaret have also been with me for quite a long time...)<br>
<br>
I spent 10 yuan to open a QQ member and set up 4 QQ groups, which are still in 
use today, and the forum management is also discussed in groups.<br>
<br>
After the forum application, blog application has sprung up. I have opened a 
large number of blogs and spaces in various portal websites to publicize my 
ideas.<br>
<br>
There are also some portal websites that allow netizens to open their own forum 
sections. Where I can find them, I have opened my own personal sections, such as 
Netease, 21cn, Xici, Xilu, Google forum, Lycos club, interactive power, etc., to 
tirelessly publicize my ideas.<br>
<br>
MySpace made friends. After a while, she also made some female friends. The 
eldest sister became a disciple naturally ---- nerve 24. Yimin Christ is the 
reason why I trust him. He does not seek fame or reward. He preaches God. He 
works for God. It should be said that he is very hard and deserves to be the son 
of God. It is when Ge Hua is in full bloom that the &quot;Lord&quot; laughs in the 
bushes~~----<br>
<br>
In 2004, Baidu Post Bar rose and quickly became popular. My saint yeme and 
plastic ID were only 1 month less than Robin Lee. I registered St. Yemei as a 
god bar owner, registered plastic products as a god bar owner, then registered 
yexue as a Christian bar owner, and registered Guo Hongmei as a god bar owner 
and a believer bar owner... Neuro has commented on &quot;seizing the top of the 
Christian mountain&quot;.<br>
<br>
This is what God knows. I invited you to be the administrator of Yemei, who 
competed with the administrator of the star sky. Each of you had his own 
support, which made Yemei very popular.<br>
<br>
At the end of 2004, Yemei ranked the top four beauties in the list of Benben and 
XingKong. The two sides who swiped the tickets replied &quot;I&quot; or &quot;XingKong&quot;, and 
litchi was also on the list.<br>
<br>
We also rated the top ten members. At that time, there were many people, and the 
forum was a popular time.<br>
<br>
Six things I had to do when surfing the Internet:<br>
<br>
1. Official website update, community background backup 2, post bar 3, blog 4, 
major forums 5, QQ mailbox 6, making friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter VII<br>
<br>
I created Yemei bar in Baidu Post Bar, which was once very popular. However, the 
popularity of Yahweh bar is far less than that of Yemei bar. Many Christians are 
very disappointed. They say that I am just a Christian, arrogant and arrogant, 
attack my heretical thoughts, and complain about yexue&#39;s Christian bar owner. 
They celebrate it as a great achievement.<br>
<br>
I looked everywhere for forums to spread my gospel. There was a main forum in 
Singapore, which was related to Christianity. I went to post, but no one else 
posted, but it was all my posts. Later, it closed and opened a section in the 
MSN community. Of course, I also opened a section in the MSN community. I even 
preached the gospel on the TVB discussion board in Hong Kong:)<br>
<br>
After the Baidu Post Bar was opened, it became my main battlefield, established 
a large number of IDS, became a lot of bar owners, and posted to the major post 
bars. As long as the traffic ranked high, I would go, including the space 
material bar, and the three largest bars must go: Li Yi bar, worldofwarcraft 
bar, 2012 bar, post publicity, and reply to interact with netizens.<br>
<br>
My number has four sources: 1. Registered by myself; 2. Take my son&#39;s number 
(more than 20); 3. Netizen Huahan Longxing gave it to me (dozens of them); 4. 
Other netizens gave it away and bought it with Paul. I have about 160 numbers in 
total, and manual screen number brushing is enough. While the disciple Paul ge 
used tools to brush the screen. After brushing, he basically sealed it. They all 
bought numbers. Each number was 1 to 5 yuan. He repeatedly sealed it and bought 
it. His total number was about 700.<br>
<br>
The God bar, God bar, Yemei bar, gospel bar, Lord bar, believer bar and so on, 
which I am the Lord of the bar, were closed in a religious cleanup. I 
immediately established the true God and St. Jeme.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m glad to apply to the prophet bar, because it has a good name. Also made the 
inspiration bar, the god religion bar, the God party bar, the classic nerve bar 
and other bar owners.<br>
<br>
Geyimin bar has existed for several years and has become my main force. It is 
very popular.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I am keen on building websites. In addition to the static 
official website and official forum, I use the Zhimeng website building system 
to build several websites such as beauty, Taobao, photo, etc. to buy domain 
names, I usually use a charging host, and then apply for a large amount of free 
space, both at home and abroad. When there is more free space, I use secondary 
domain name resolution, and often go to free resource websites to find free 
space.<br>
<br>
I have also built a large number of blogs. I have used a &quot;blog group sending 
tool&quot;, and a portal website has built several numbers. It automatically searches 
for online article publishing, and automatically adds my web address to the end 
of the article.<br>
<br>
I also use the post bar program to establish my own post bar on my website, such 
as Yemei post bar, geyimin post bar, and some people send gay pictures. Baidu 
Post Bar can&#39;t send them. Go to geyimin post bar to send them.<br>
<br>
The official website has gained a certain popularity. I have successively 
applied for Google alliance and Baidu alliance. Google took a check for $100 and 
Baidu took a few hundred yuan.<br>
<br>
Later, PHP became popular, and all spaces supported PHP. The god community 
driven Network Forum (ASP) was changed to DZ Forum (PHP).<br>
<br>
Nerve XIV (IX). Cultural media<br>
<br>
1. As a community administrator and my righteous younger sister, huangjingbo, a

<br>
4. Beijing little lily has been a netizen together for a long time. She used to 
be a community administrator of Ge Yimin. She is against my faith, but she is 
still my best friend. But she was afraid that others would misunderstand her as 
Ge Hua, so she quit Baidu Ge Yimin post bar and walked away. Later, she said to 
me, go back. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t pay attention. She PS many funny pictures 
about me and wrote long, insightful and funny comments on me. She is my grace. I 
often miss the days when I am happy with her.<br>
<br>
5. Sister Mingjing shuistop has been a good friend for many years. Maybe it is 
because she often keeps a distance that the friendship can last. She is a 
rational little Buddhist sister, but if the distance is too long, the friendship 
will fade.<br>
<br>
6. How many Internet girls have left me, because my time hasn&#39;t come yet.<br>
<br>
7. Because of the domain name and space, the website has been redone many times. 
Fortunately, the gospel has spread after all.<br>

<br>
14. In 2018, the Apostle Ge Paul converted to ge Yimin God. This is a great 
conversion, and its significance is no less than that of the Apostle Paul&#39;s 
conversion to Jesus. Just as Paul preached the gospel of Jesus, the Apostle Ge 
Paul widely preached the gospel of Ge Yimin God in Baidu Post Bar. Preaching Ge 
Yimin is the truth of God.<br>
<br>

Chapter VIII<br>
<br>
In 2004, in the era of Benben and starry sky, Yemei reached a climax. Benben (Li 
Juan) and I fell in love online.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(after many years, in 2004, I fell in love with an Internet girl, Lijuan, from 
Deyang, Sichuan Province. I met Baidu tieba and became a community administrator 
of Yemei. At first, I was just a little sister. She wanted to be my lover. She 
sent messages to each other to express her love. Both sides had made sincere 
efforts. I wanted to stay in the community and also expressed my love to others. 
Li Juan found out that I was ill and hospitalized. Everything was irreparable. 
After breaking up, she said the reason was impossible Together. I really love 
her. I often recall that she gave me videos as soon as I chatted on QQ. I was 
moved inexplicably.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On QQ, I let Ben choose the relationship: 1. Sister, 2. Confidante, 3. Lover. 
Ben chose his lover.<br>
<br>
In order to keep people in the community, I also had an online love affair with 
other girls in yemeqi, including the woman Lizi:) Wan Qing with bad legs (later, 
Ben Ben told me.) I used the drawing software to make an online marriage 
certificate for each girl, and also pasted photos of both sides. In the name of 
God, the rich and the poor are not separated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(nerve 27 (3) 505. Furthermore, Yemei is already the father of the child, but is 
still so mean as to deceive the young administrator himself. When I knew the 
truth, he vowed to divorce his wife and marry me. I believed him and began to 
wait with expectation. However, the dream turned into a nightmare, and Yemei 
later confessed to the administrator XingKong, and made advances to the then 
yemeire Pavilion moderator glacier tiannv. Yemei told the girls that she was the 
only one in his heart, and he had no such feelings for others. Later, glacier 
believed it and decided to leave Yemei under pressure. When I asked him to stay, 
the truth finally came out.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know how many people have been cheated by Yemei. This is really a 
shameful act.<br>
<br>
Later, I posted a post on Yemei, asking Yemei, what is God given marriage? &quot;God 
given marriage&quot; was what Yemei said when she told binghe that she wanted to 
marry binghe online and was confident of bringing this marriage into reality. 
There is nothing more despicable than deceiving the feelings of believers under 
the banner of God.<br>
<br>
After that, Yemei never showed up to avoid. Later, Yemei explained that she went 
to interview the veteran soldiers, but the place was remote and had no Internet. 
Faced with such a coincidence, most people began to laugh at Yemei.<br>
<br>
A long time later, Yemei shamefully sent a post to defend herself. The title was 
&quot;I admit I love myself, and I also admit I love the stars&quot;. What a shameless 
beast! What about your wife? What about your children? Why did you say such a 
thing? Did you think of them when you said that?)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, at the time of the incident, I was ill and hospitalized (mental 
hospital:), unable to deal with the crisis in time. When I was hospitalized, 
they made an appointment to leave Yemei and opened their own forum. Lizi is 
still in Yemei. She doesn&#39;t admit to having an online marriage certificate. She 
is much older than me. XingKong is still posting on Yemei. XingKong has posted 
on their forum. I blame her for not posting on Yemei.<br>
<br>
The administrator of my notebook kept it for a long time, and she repeatedly 
asked me to cancel it. Her post &quot;what is a god given marriage?&quot;, When I saw it, 
it had been edited by her. It&#39;s a pity that I didn&#39;t see the content.<br>
<br>
I used the free space to open a forum &quot;anti Yemei alliance&quot;. The book came back 
and asked the forum owner (actually me, reverse propaganda) for the QQ number.<br>
<br>
Later, when she contacted Benben on QQ, she said that it was impossible to be 
together.<br>
<br>
(nerve14 3. Fell in love with Sichuan girl Lijuan (herself). Later, she said 
that it was impossible to be together. This is my third true love. It&#39;s a pity 
that Plato.)<br>
<br>
Later, I saw Benben&#39;s post in the post bar:<br>
<br>
(nerve 27 (3) 376. I will take back the things that belong to me.)<br>
<br>
Dear Ben, do I ge Yimin belong to you?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter IX<br>
<br>
Wan Qing is a Christian. She likes to write essays. She has leg problems. She 
even knew that I had given her an online marriage certificate and accused me. 
She is a girl who I made friends with on Yahoo. As a moderator, she is very 
responsible and serious. She said that the online name was taken from Mu Wanqing 
in the eight books of the dragon, which is meaningless.<br>
<br>
Wan Qing said that when her brother was poor, he won a large sum of money at the 
Las Vegas Casino in the United States. I said miracles and asked her to post a 
post in Yemei. She won the lottery because Christians were hard to say gambling.<br>
<br>
Wanqing also left Yemei with the book and went to their forum, but the forum was 
not popular. In the end, Wanqing was the only one who posted a post a day, and 
no one clicked.<br>
<br>
After Benben left Yemei, a girl named huangjingbo (laughing at life) came to the 
community. She worked as a technician in Shenzhen. Her hometown is Taiwan. She 
is very beautiful and young. She became my righteous sister and became a 
community administrator instead of Benben. QQ interacted with the community at 
night, and SMS interacted during the day. At that time, there was no mobile QQ, 
around 2006.<br>
<br>
Huangjingbo calls me a prophet and calls himself an angel. The angels and 
prophets should be together:) although she is a righteous sister, she is also in 
online love. I have sent her a desert spring and a Bible (small version of Hong 
Kong Version). I wonder if she can receive the Bible? Later, she was busy with 
her work and lost her mind. Finally, she still left me a message: &quot;when the song 
is brilliant, I will travel with you naturally.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that time, there were many girls as moderators in Yemei. Naturally, I pulled 
them from dating websites, such as mingluo, dreamy ice bamboo, and so on. They 
all wrote articles in Yemei. For example, in the Yemei re Cultural Museum, 
mingluo wrote a very good post, saying that everyone was very happy in Yemei at 
that time. She said that everyone had their own style of writing. She liked 
everyone, who she liked, who she liked, and who she liked... PS I seem to have 
opened the harem:)<br>
<br>
There is a Yunnan girl in the community who dreams of butterfly dancing. She 
tells me everything. She also tells me after drinking beer with several friends. 
She also sends photos. On the eve of the Spring Festival, I send a text message 
to her to say goodbye to the new year. She calls me and says that I am married. 
It seems that she means to leave me.<br>
<br>
When Han Wufeng, a girl from Xuzhou, came to Yemei, she was still in high 
school. She also loved writing. She called me twice and said she couldn&#39;t bear 
to see me alone. How can a high school girl not be moved to think about me like 
this?<br>
<br>
There is a personal post on Mingjing waterstop. She said that in my photos 
(University graduation photos, white shirts), it is rare for Chinese people to 
have a clear face like westerners. She believes in Buddhism and we often discuss 
religion. She posted my photos on a forum to make people look at them (see 
below).<br>
<br>
Once she gave me a &quot;new Buddhist&quot; bar, saying that I could send nerves. I sent 
it, and it was deleted. I said that Mingjing waterstop asked me to come. The bar 
master dared to explain that, let me be sure not to delete nerves. She has a 
rallying power to say that she is a friend of my sister.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 694. When I was in Yemei community, I wrote a paragraph and went 
to dating websites, such as Yahoo, to make friends, search for women, and then 
paste them one by one without looking at their information. I invited many girls 
to the community, such as Wanqing. I also talked with the internet police and 
the Religious Affairs Bureau. I called it &quot;hair when you see a woman&quot;. They were 
also surprised. I said that making friends means that men make women, and women 
make men.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (1) 130. Clear mirror water stop: Ge Yimin is a Christian and 
independent of his own sect<br>
<br>
He claims to be a prophet, son of God, man of God, and leader of the church. His 
foundation for the creation of religion is &quot;visions&quot;, which is actually the 
so-called supernatural dreams he had from childhood to adulthood (I don&#39;t think 
so). Therefore, he has also written his own doctrinal scriptures. Therefore, he 
has also been attacked by many people on the Internet. However, after contact, I 
feel that I am still very good. I also take an inclusive attitude towards other 
beliefs. At least it is much better than other Christians who often accuse 
Buddhism, Taoism, qigong and yoga as evil spirits on the Internet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (1) 134. I can&#39;t see the truth, but I can&#39;t see that GE Yimin has the 
image of a saint, but it gives people a sense of persistence. It&#39;s a bit like 
the image of a revolutionary in the 1920s. Ha ha<br>
<br>
The work piece is a bit like Michael Jackson~<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter X<br>
<br>
Baidu Yongsheng Post Bar trading event.<br>
<br>
In july2010, my ID Ge Yimin and Majia yexue were the eternal bar owners. Of 
course, they were used as propaganda nerves. One day, many bar friends suddenly 
came and posted many posts. It turned out that the new fantasy novel, which was 
dreamed of by the Internet writers, was named &quot;eternal life&quot;, and the novel fans 
poured into eternal life.<br>
<br>
At that time, many people applied for big and small bar owners. I approved 10 
small bar owners. Two Youzi &quot;first-class earth immortals&quot; and &quot;indescribable 
debauchery&quot; came to me to be the third bar owner. &quot;Debauchery&quot; I agreed, but he 
could not apply, but others could. Of course, I refused. It seems that Baidu 
made me a little rich.<br>
<br>
After that, the fans who dreamed of Shenji contacted me at the Shenji camp to 
buy a bar for 1000 yuan. After paying me 150, the third bar owner &quot;eternal life 
bar management&quot; was quickly added. I resigned yexue and added another bar owner 
of Shenji camp, but Baidu failed to pass, which took me threeorfour days. I 
spent a lot of time managing the bar, bar friends and posts. Because I didn&#39;t 
manage well, my geyimin bar owner couldn&#39;t keep it and sold gross money:) 
&quot;first-class earth immortals&quot; and &quot;indescribable debauchery&quot; and so on, and all 
kinds of reports were delayed.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t think the third bar owner can add it. If it&#39;s not a problem, I&#39;ll talk 
to Shenji camp and give him the geyimin number, totaling 1500 yuan. He&#39;s very 
happy and says 1600 or 1700 is OK. I gave the Ge Yimin, and the third bar owner 
added it. I wanted the balance. He paid 850, 1000, 500 less. He also resigned 
the Ge Yimin. Later, some people sent QQ group screenshots. They gave me a lot 
of money to buy bar owners. I failed to ask for 500. They posted a large number 
of posts to expose the dark scenes of online novels. They said that online 
novels were hyped and bought and sold bar owners. They also posted them on the 
people&#39;s network. I posted them in groups on many websites. It was also hyped 
for me and became famous in the novel circle.<br>
<br>
Later, a small bar I removed returned the geyimin to me.<br>
<br>
In 2021, the eternal life bar owner was removed. I, xujinglei Kaila, applied for 
the bar owner again, but now it is no longer popular. Time has changed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 366. Facial mask: the past and present lives of the mentally ill 
Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
Comrade Ge Yimin once served as the bar owner of the eternal life bar with his 
Majia yexue, and was bought by the Shenji camp at the price of 3000 yuan (he 
claimed to be a Christian at the beginning and was unwilling to make money 
transactions). As a result, because of his limited IQ, Ge Yimin took out both 
bar owner passwords after taking the 1000 down payment. As a result, he was 
cheated, and then changed his Majia to black the Shenji camp in different forums 
and major post bars for four years, It can be seen from his deep resentment and 
boredom.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (3) 686, &quot;I&#39;m a big villain&quot; is an online article. It&#39;s a novel written 
by someone when I had a dispute with the online writer about dreaming into the 
Shenji fans&#39; Shenji camp. Wang Zhong dreamed into the Shenji, and some 
characters were later immortal bar owners. Ma Jia yexue and I were bar owners, 
Because his new novel is called &quot;eternal life&quot; Shenji camp, he asked me to buy a 
bar owner and sold it for 1000 yuan. Because their bar owner was slow, many 
people looked at it and it took me too much time. It was agreed that I would 
give the account &quot;geyimin&quot; and 1500, but still only 1000.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 854. The vast crowd 2: tell me about the Shenji camp incident 
that was so noisy before hogshey.<br>
<br>
In july2010, the online writer dreamed of Shenji&#39;s new work &quot;eternal life&quot;, and 
his fan group was Shenji camp. At this time, a person in Shenji camp wanted to 
buy the post bar with the same name by buying and selling in RMB. At that time, 
Yongsheng bar was controlled by GE Yimin and his vest (it was in 2006), so the 
two sides began to quarrel. As a result, hogshen asked 1500 yuan to agree to 
their request, but in the end, he only got 1000 yuan, At that time, Hushen also 
shook out the evidence of Shenji camp&#39;s buying bar, and said: &quot;it was said that 
the three bar owners took the stage for 1600 and 1700, but the result was only 
1000, and I wanted 1500. No, their attitude was bad. They were unkind, and I was 
also unjust.&quot;. Later, he Shen also wrote an article &quot;the beginning of the fierce 
battle - the goal is not the eternal bar master, but the magic machine, but the 
vertical and horizontal&quot;. In the following years, Ge Hua (although all owned by 
him) has been brushing the screen of &quot;the vertical and horizontal boss \ 
dreaming into the magic machine&quot;.<br>
<br>
In those days, Zongheng Chinese network supported the people of Shenji camp to 
occupy eternal life bar. For this reason, the bid was as high as five figures. 
Hogshen wanted 1500, but Baima and others had to pay in installments. They 
didn&#39;t resign Ge Yimin. Hogg also agreed. He gave them the password of GE Yimin 
when he gave them 1000. But at that time, they not only resigned geyimin and 
replaced him with several numbers of the Shenji camp, but also didn&#39;t give him 
the remaining 500. At this time, Shenji camp started to quarrel with each other. 
He didn&#39;t care about the 500 yuan. After hearing this, he asked for a balance of 
500 yuan. Instead, they gave him no money. Instead, he got up and sang Yimin 
listened. He wanted to send the whole QQ transaction web record (bad PS) and 
Alipay transaction record to the Internet, but it ended in nothing.<br>
<br>
》Yexue: it&#39;s been a long time. I have two chatting records of bar owners.<br>
<br>
In fact, the network comments on me, whether the information is true or false, I 
still included it into the nerve.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 947. The boundless crowd 2: in other words, the bar owner who 
applied for immortality bar passed, and successfully occupied it. In a sense, it 
is the return of the old bar owner.<br>
<br>
Batu was originally written by a novelist about immortality, but Ge later used 
Ge Laoren&#39;s picture to make him famous.<br>
<br>
But I&#39;m looking forward to ge Hei&#39;s holding this bar one day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XI<br>
<br>
In the early days, there were only a few m mailboxes. Sina built a 60m mailbox, 
called a large capacity mailbox, and soon changed it back to a few m. Later, 
Google Gmail came, i.e. 1g. Many people registered first. I also introduced it 
to netizens. The earliest thing was to invite them to register. I also said that 
they would register sooner or later.<br>
<br>
Later, when Iran blocked Gmail, I laughed and thought, it&#39;s just email service, 
but we won&#39;t, and then...<br>
<br>
The rise of Twitter and Facebook in the United States, I have registered. At 
that time, it was not blocked. I used to use Facebook in Internet cafes. I 
followed Obama when he was recommended by twitter. Maybe I didn&#39;t choose the 
Chinese interface. My twitter is in English, so I became nervous. I have been 
following Obama all the time and have no fans. Maybe I have a lot of Chinese 
nerves, a Chinese interface appears, and there are more and more fans, but I 
only close a few people. Now we are following 10 people and 800 fans.<br>
<br>
Facebook started as a Chinese interface, and Weiyao (a small fallen leaf in 
Yemei community) and others added me as friends. Later, the system recommended 
beauties from all over the world, and PS knew that I liked beauties:) I applied 
for a large number of friends, that is, click once, and if the other party 
passed, they will become friends. If they failed for a long time, I will cancel 
the application for friends, and click once again. Now there are 800 friends, 
all of whom are beauties from all over the world. Of course, I also use Facebook 
to send nerves. Later, I built three personal home pages and three groups. At 
present, there are 177 to 521 fans on the homepage, and more than a dozen 
members of the group.<br>
<br>
At that time, Google also set up a google+, which was similar to Facebook. I 
also applied, and set up three groups to get nervous every day. Later, Google 
shut down google+.<br>
<br>
I also set up several channels to upload micro vision short video (nerve), YY 
live video (nerve) and Ge Yimin video (hymn and Ge Hua&#39;s creation), which were 
also broadcast live. But the broadcast volume was terrible. I was the most 
popular of the three tweets. The big guys in them all paid attention to me 
first, and then I closed it. Facebook came second, and the oil pipe came second.<br>
<br>
Of course, I also go to many overseas Chinese forums and blogs, all of which are 
crazy. There is a rainbow covenant Forum on the world wide web. It is a 
Christian Forum. I often post articles. Later, Christians condemned me as 
heretical and banned me.<br>
<br>
There are also websites such as beikeqin, Boxun, Duowei, blogger, udn, Tang 
brere, reddit, and literature city. Several blogs (such as beikeqin, Boxun, and 
wanwei) have received hundreds of thousands of hits. Now, Ge Shenyi&#39;s news has 
more than 1000 hits every day on the world wide blog, making it a 24-hour hot 
list.<br>
<br>
Weiming was unable to register before. It said that IP was illegal. Later, it 
was registered. Now there is a section full of my articles.<br>
<br>
When shielding, I began to use the wheel. Later, the disciples sent a fog pass. 
They paid for it for two months. They found that it was also possible to use it 
for free, so they always used it for free.<br>
<br>
When I post, it is an article. All websites send it once, and even the condiment 
website restricts me. It says that the same article is sent everywhere. On the 
condiment website, someone pretended to be my anti gravity, causing me to be 
summoned. He was afraid of canceling the number. I registered to prevent others 
from pretending again, but after some nerves, I left the condiment related 
website.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 21 23. The police asked me for twitter, Facebook, wechat, QQ and other 
accounts and passwords. I used the Internet under my real name. Although I knew 
that the police had infringed the law, I still gave it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 387. Star Tang Yan and Ge Shen tweet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 801. The vast crowd: how to treat Ge Yimin?<br>
<br>
Apart from other things, it&#39;s just a divine stick, but the only thing that makes 
me curious is that his endurance has been preaching the divine religion all over 
the Internet, such as twitter, YTB, Facebook, a follower, and even the Hong Kong 
Forum. It has been preached almost inside and outside the wall, and it has been 
preaching and brushing the screen every day. He has worked hard to preach the 
gospel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 802. The vast sea of people: the world wide web has been there, 
just as you said. On twitter, some adults did pay attention to you. What about 
the female star. You are a very unusual God.<br>
<br>
》Deyang Lijuan: I pay attention to twitter. The people I went back to were all 
top pro democracy activists. There are also some people whose information is too 
much for me to return.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (2) 744. Black tone: who is g God and people? You talk about him all 
day long<br>
<br>
His channel is still on the oil pipe.<br>
<br>
747. Black ground control: there is a complete collection of nerves on the oil 
pipe<br>
<br>
There is still sound, even pictures.<br>
<br>
755. Black earth tune: there are many words about the oil pipe singing Jinshan 
in Zhenjiang<br>
<br>
The golden mountain in Zhenjiang shines everywhere,<br>
<br>
Chairman Ge is the golden red sun.<br>
<br>
Do many people make pilgrimages to Zhenjiang every year?<br>
<br>

Chapter 12<br>
<br>
At that time, there was &quot;free book request&quot; on the home page of Shenwang 
(several links in it were websites providing free books), and I was also keen on 
free books. There are dozens of &quot;Christ&quot; in Korea:) a new life preacher sent me 
a box of books, the gospel of the Holy Spirit in blood and water, which is not 
only his own understanding of the Bible, but also his own sect.<br>
<br>
There is a happy letter website in Taiwan. I have learned lessons on it. She is 
a real Jesus church. I passed the exam and got excellent students. She sent me a 
record. They sang by their religious friends. They had a beautiful female voice. 
I said it was the best Christmas gift. She said that they were not Christmas, 
because the date was not Jesus&#39; birthday.<br>
<br>
There is a website that has successively sent me thick and big books. In front 
of them are Chinese and English Bibles, one in several volumes, and behind them 
are their exegesis. Some websites sent me CDs, such as Christian books and 
periodicals website.<br>
<br>
In the Yahoo China Forum, there was Taiwanese interaction. He wanted me to 
express the public opinion not to unify Taiwan, saying that public opinion could 
affect government decisions. I replied: &quot;we need Taiwan, the gateway to the 
sea.&quot;<br>

After my righteous sister huangjingbo left Shenwang, a Beijing girl named Lili 
came to the community. She was Bai Fumi, a Christian, and a little lily in the 
greenhouse where the bar would be posted in the future. We are MSN friends. I 
added her as a community administrator. We chatted while posting in the evening. 
She said that she would control my time and I would go offline at about 10 
o&#39;clock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 14 (9) 4. Beijing xiaobaihe has been a netizen together for a long time. 
She used to be a community administrator of Ge Yimin. She is against my faith, 
but she is still my best friend. But she was afraid that others would 
misunderstand her as Ge Hua, so she quit Baidu Ge Yimin post bar and walked 
away. Later, she said to me, go back. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t pay attention. 
She PS many funny pictures about me and wrote long, insightful and funny 
comments on me. She is my grace. I often miss the days when I am happy with her.<br>

<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 360. Lili: Ge Yimin, a heresy<br>
<br>
》Geyimin classic 31 / 01 / 2016<br>
<br>
Nerve 1 5. In the spring of 2001, I dreamed that the Apostle Paul took a boat to 
San Paolo, Brazil, in the Southeast Asian waters to preach back and forth. God 
made me like him. (GE Yimin is called to preach)<br>
<br>
》》God made you like him. Just do it!<br>
<br>
Paul is a servant of God. He preaches the word of God among the Gentiles instead 
of elevating himself and establishing the &quot;Paul Church&quot;. Not to transform the 
social system.<br>
<br>
》6. In the autumn of 2001, in a strange dream, God said, &quot;I am God. Listen to 
him.&quot; He refers to song Yimin. (GE Yimin is called as a prophet)<br>
<br>
》》Why should we listen to the songs of millions of people? Why not listen to 
God? Are you God?<br>
<br>
》9. 20020827, in a vision, he ascended to heaven on the campus of his alma 
mater. God said, &quot;I am God. Listen to him.&quot; this is my beloved son. I like it<br>
<br>
Listen to him, you who are happy. &quot;A cloud came down, and he sang to hundreds of 
millions of people.<br>
<br>
》》This is what the heavenly father said about the Son Jesus. Obviously equate 
yourself with Jesus. See yourself as God.<br>
<br>
》15. 20071227, in a strange dream, geyimin&#39;s body slowly rose to the sky and 
became the sun, shining on the earth.<br>
<br>
》》The East is red, the sun is rising, and the world is full of people!<br>
<br>
》27. In A.D. 2019, Satan was forever thrown into the fire lake of sulfur. When 
God executed the judgment, the new heaven and new earth, the national era 
(Communist society).<br>
<br>
》》Is Xintian and Xindi Communist socialism? Did Jesus come into the world to be 
a secretary or a president?<br>
<br>
》66. Christian Communists disdain to conceal their own views: in the future 
communist society, everyone has normal married children, and their extramarital 
affairs are not morally prohibited. In the future communist society, any adult 
man or woman can go to Wushan together if both sides are willing. This behavior 
is not morally prohibited, and human beings are completely happy and harmonious.<br>
<br>
》》Looking at today&#39;s society, it seems that we have achieved &quot;communism&quot;! Is 
this what you want?<br>
<br>
》71. In the Communist society, labor is not a need, let alone a primary need, 
but voluntary and self-conscious.<br>
<br>
》》Voluntary and conscious labor? This is completely unrealistic fantasy,<br>
<br>
People are lazy and greedy. How can you be willing to work?<br>
<br>
There is also distribution on demand. I would like to have the world. Am I 
asking too much? Or just want to eat? What is the standard of people&#39;s needs?<br>
<br>
Summary: Ge Yimin, a heretical theory!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XIII<br>
<br>
Baihe once had an Italian boyfriend. Her grandfather was a senior official. He 
once told me that once she and her grandfather stayed in a hotel and armed 
police stood guard. Her father is a businessman and believes in Jesus. She 
believes that Jesus follows her father. She uploaded a large number of photos on 
the MSN China website. I started to upload photos, only a few of which were 
scanned in the unit. She also said that it was just a little.<br>
<br>
I introduced Ge Yimin to her. At first, she thought that GE Yimin was the 
official of Baidu. Later, she opened a personal club in the post bar and posted 
a lot of posts. Later, the post bar closed the club.<br>
<br>
At first, her ID was the bird in the cage. I can&#39;t say it with the plastic 
product number. The bird meant little boy. So she registered the little lily in 
the greenhouse and became a philosophy bar owner.<br>
<br>
Baihe last posted on September 26th, 2014. After a few days of sporadic replies, 
she didn&#39;t appear. According to her character, she won&#39;t leave the post bar. I&#39;m 
very worried about accidents. A year or two later, she came to the post bar once 
and replied to the village girl: &quot;have you read my message?&quot; Since she 
disappeared again, I&#39;m so worried about her body accident. I asked the content 
of Lily&#39;s message last time, but he refused to say...<br>

Nerve XXVII (III) 559. Chatting with Lili about faith<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Li, your post is back to you. Have a look<br>
<br>
Thank you for your responsibility. I&#39;m very happy after hard work<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve been waiting for you all night. Thank you for discussing my faith. It&#39;s 
been a long time. I like to be criticized by others, which is good for me<br>
<br>
. As long as you don&#39;t leave, I&#39;ll be satisfied, Li.<br>

I said last time<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t want to be a moderator of sensitive topics<br>
<br>
I&#39;m afraid of that<br>
<br>
Or<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Prophet forum is not sensitive<br>
<br>
Full Gospel Forum<br>
<br>
No personal belongings<br>
<br>
Or I&#39;ll move you to the Yimin version, huh<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
I am conservative in your forum<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
If you are honest, the wind will be extreme<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
otherwise<br>
<br>
You&#39;re welcome<br>
<br>
This is not an ordinary Forum<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t want that<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
It&#39;s all right, Li. Just say what you want. This is the Internet<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
At least he&#39;s my friend<br>
<br>
Ignore him<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t think so<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Ah, the forum is a debate, just say what you want<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Not malicious<br>
<br>
I think that&#39;s all<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Yes, he was motivated by his hatred of heresy<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t like heresy either<br>
<br>
I have a good opinion of you<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
I know<br>
<br>
I just thought, no action<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Your theory<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Of course, there are many objections<br>
<br>
Especially in Christianity, new ideas are always heretical<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Not necessarily<br>
<br>
You are too selfish<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Oh, Li, if it proves that my dream is not from God, I will take it back<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
How does it come from God?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
It&#39;s only in the Bible. - listen to him<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Too many people / I want to be invisible<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
good<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
What do you mean by him, you or something<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
In a strange dream, it means me<br>
<br>
I wonder, too<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
I guess so<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
You look like your old book. She mainly opposes 2019<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Who is Ben?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
A girl, former administrator<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
This sentence will be opposed<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
I inferred from Daniel<br>
<br>
Mainly expectation<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
You are God yourself<br>
<br>
Even higher than the prophet<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
God is the creator, the only one<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Listen to you. Are you all right?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
I&#39;m surprised<br>
<br>
Wait for God<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
The determination is wrong<br>
<br>
Even confuse many people<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
This dream is still very clear<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Maybe the devil?<br>
<br>
Have you thought of it?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Indefinable<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
And the Communist co wife<br>
<br>
Could it be God&#39;s will?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
This is the last form of imagining human beings<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
The kingdom of God is not what it is today<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t imagine the transition of God with the secular world<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Today is not a communist wife<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
of course<br>
<br>
We do not believe in God to change the world<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Non conflicting<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
To save everyone<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Western Christians have no conflict with politics<br>
<br>
To be saved, we should also live in reality<br>
<br>
Nice talking to you<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
thanks<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Can you send the record to the forum?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
We&#39;re only here for a while<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
I think the kingdom of heaven is the renewed earth<br>
<br>
Xintian Xindi<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Xintian Xindi the world will change completely<br>
<br>
Jesus is our king<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Yes, it&#39;s OK to update the earth, mainly the human mind<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
That was after seven years of disaster<br>
<br>
What you said still hasn&#39;t escaped the secular world<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
There are many views on the seven-year issue, including the first millennium, 
the second millennium and the non Millennium (the Millennium)<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
also<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
New heaven and new earth, human beings are not divorced from material life<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Biblical prophecies are hidden<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Not what?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Biblical prophecies are hidden. Let us understand more clearly. Those who don&#39;t 
understand, those who connect, and those who arrive will also lose<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
How did your theology come about?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Xintian and Xindi are definitely not material<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Xindi is not the earth?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
yes<br>
<br>
But it&#39;s not what you think<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Living immaterially on earth?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Not based on matter<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Of course, the soul comes first<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Think about it. The dead are raised<br>
<br>
Or material?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
In fact, this man can&#39;t figure it out until the Lord comes again<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
We seem to be robots<br>
<br>
How is it possible to know what the makers think<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
No, our search for God&#39;s work is endless<br>
<br>
Free will, new heaven and new earth<br>
<br>
I see you<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Just like the fish in the water, how do you know what the land looks like?<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Agree with you<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
You told him there were trees and beautiful flowers<br>
<br>
He won&#39;t understand<br>
<br>
Because his limitations are in the water<br>
<br>
He had no idea how beautiful the land was<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
I agree with you very much. Now people can&#39;t understand how xintianxindi is<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Imagine that the land is the same as the water<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
How did you get your theological knowledge?<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
I hope you give up your unrealistic ideas<br>
<br>
Hee hee<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
If the evidence is wrong, give up<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
My father used to tell me<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Oh, you are true<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Actually, I know very little<br>
<br>
I&#39;m talking nonsense<br>
<br>
Just casually<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
That&#39;s right<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Hee hee<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
<br>
Correct your typos when you put them in the Forum<br>
<br>
Hee hee<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t change, I understand<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
oh<br>
<br>
I hope you give up your heresy as soon as possible<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
Prove wrong, I will give up<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
grace<br>
<br>
Can you tell me what I thought of you before?<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t be angry<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
good<br>
<br>
Not angry<br>
<br>
Like criticism<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Highly narcissistic. Self righteous. Want to be independent. A follower who 
pretends to be God and doesn&#39;t know the truth.<br>
<br>
Ambitious<br>
<br>
Hee hee<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
The main reason is that the dream came from God<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Just don&#39;t get angry<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
I will not call myself God. I think God is the creator, the only one. All people 
are created<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
Strange dreams may be just an excuse for your purpose<br>
<br>
I speak directly<br>
<br>
sorry<br>
<br>
I hope you understand<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
It&#39;s not an excuse. I really think the dream comes from God. I think it&#39;s a 
mission<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
You don&#39;t call yourself God, but you&#39;re the same<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
It won&#39;t be the same<br>
<br>
I think God is the creator God, and all people are created<br>
<br>
Lili said:<br>
<br>
By making others listen to you, you equate yourself with God<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said:<br>
<br>
No, it doesn&#39;t mean that. It&#39;s the original words in a strange dream. It&#39;s an 
actual record<br>

Chapter 14<br>
<br>
Lily is very beautiful. She has a characteristic. She calls you you. No matter 
who she treats, even a little girl of God net can&#39;t stand it. She says, &quot;I&#39;m 
only 19.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crape myrtle saints have sprung up on the Internet. Baidu Chinese sage bar is 
very popular. Little lily posted a post, which was deleted by a little Taoist. 
She came to ge Yimin bar to complain. Ge Hua posted a post at the Chinese sage 
bar, which has developed into a screen brushing in the future.<br>
<br>
At that time, there was a village girl in Ge Yimin bar. She was a man from 
Northeast China. He was a few years younger than me and became a friend of lily. 
She was also recommended by Ni Zi to go to the Chinese sage bar.<br>
<br>
Later, Baihe became a Chinese saint, Xiao ba. But later, she saw through that 
the prophecy was false, stopped participating and resigned.<br>
<br>
Baihe is from Beijing. She has houses in both Dongcheng District and Xicheng 
District. Her father gave her a suite in Dongcheng District. After the 
decoration, she sent me a photo and I said, &quot;it will be used as a wedding room 
in the future.&quot; She said: &quot;(the man) has no room, can&#39;t think.&quot;:)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve XVII (VI). The so-called impossible: who does little lily say sits in the 
Department? Who does coolie? A good solution: take turns. Do this today and that 
tomorrow. Everyone can do different jobs according to their interests. They are 
willing to serve all mankind. Human morality is generally improved. Everyone is 
willing to serve Ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 24 85. Lily, No. You are the administrator of Shenwang. Ge Yimin owes you 
too much You must answer in the future The only difference between us is that 
you are the Bible and tradition, and we are seeking higher truth, because God is 
infinite Truth is infinite You say that we are not Christians. In fact, we have 
always been. There are a lot of things about Jesus and the Bible on our nerves. 
But because of the above, we have established a divine religion to be closer to 
God Approach the truth.<br>
<br>
86. Lily, you are kind to ge Yimin, so we care about you most. You oppose Ge 
Yimin&#39;s belief. We are not angry, but also very happy, because there is a place 
for GE Yimin in your heart. Your comments on Ge Yimin&#39;s posts are collected on 
Ge Yimin&#39;s official website. But you showed that you saw through Ge Yimin. We 
were disappointed because everyone was seeking the truth and on the way.<br>
<br>
87. There is Lily. If you think a person is a friend, you can oppose him or 
scold him, but you can&#39;t despise or despise him. This is the most unacceptable 
thing for people.<br>
<br>
102. Little lily in the greenhouse: my evaluation of Ge Yimin, a highly 
narcissistic heretic who wants to hype himself, is really incompetent and lacks 
followers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerves 27 (1) 198. One hand of bread and one hand of Calligraphy: I suddenly 
found Ge Yimin. Call you saint<br>
<br>
Lily in the greenhouse: many people used to call me that, but Ge Yimin scared 
me. Now he sends &quot;advertisements&quot; everywhere.<br>
<br>
214. Fighting monsters across the line of fire: I just went to ge Yimin&#39;s bar to 
have a look<br>
<br>
Ge Hua has been pursuing the God in the fog and the little lily in the 
greenhouse. Both of them are cults<br>
<br>
232. Little lily in the greenhouse: I debated with Mr. Ge for some time, but 
later I felt it was meaningless.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel that GE Yimin just hypes himself, but he is not serious, such 
as &quot;2019 eschatology&quot;<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel tempted and used by the devil. However, there is not so much 
ability. Always entertain yourself.<br>
<br>
Who knows, confused.......... Highly narcissistic.<br>
<br>
Call yourself a prophet, Christ.<br>
<br>
You should listen to him, Ge Yimin....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter XV<br>
<br>
Lily, like Benben, opposes my faith. They are both Christians. Benben was in 
2004. Yemeni religion is still a Christian faith. She mainly opposes my 2019 
doomsday theory (which is also the beginning of a new heaven and earth). In the 
Baihe era, the deity gradually became independent. Baihe opposed my calling God 
and my communism.<br>
<br>
Benben is an online love, Baihe is a normal friend, and they have all been God 
net administrators.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerves 27 (3) 504. Little lily in the greenhouse: go to ge Yimin for the last 
time. When you leave<br>
<br>
I will stamp the dust off my feet to witness their wrongs.<br>
<br>
This is my last post to ge Yimin bar.<br>
<br>
Ben didn&#39;t want to be here. Because you said [if you don&#39;t want to, don&#39;t say 
more] (in the post where faith is not a business Post), why should I &quot;say more&quot;? 
But I want to say something when I leave. Sorry!<br>
<br>
As I said, one yuan can buy out a person&#39;s soul,<br>
<br>
Indeed, for their own popularity, they do not hesitate to fabricate, cheat and 
force others. When others don&#39;t do it, they get angry and turn over. I don&#39;t 
know whether your Ge Jiao wants to save others or let others save you? Also, 
your explanation after deleting all your friends in QQ is that [they are useless 
to me...] Very surprised! They&#39;re useless, they don&#39;t need them, so they delete 
them. This is your Ge philosophy. Is there only a relationship between people 
that is used and used? So you have no friends, not even one. It is only for 
profit. Don&#39;t pretend that God is fed by women and that you are unworthy. He 
that keepeth his mouth and his tongue preserveth himself from disaster.<br>
<br>
Every tree will recognize its fruit. Man does not pick figs from thorns, nor 
grapes from thistles.<br>
<br>
You have nothing to do with Christianity.<br>
<br>
What is it to call yourself Christianity but not to admit Christ? The reason is 
simple. You call yourself Christ. Can you still believe in the real Christ? 
Seems to be getting worse now? As long as it is good, you are all alone, even 
suggesting that you are a &quot;sage of crape myrtle&quot; (I have never heard of 
&quot;masturbating strangers&quot;). You have many professional titles! &quot;Great Internet 
religionist&quot;, &quot;thinker&quot;, &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;prophet&quot;. In fact, you only have one 
title, which is &quot;the pioneer of Satan&quot;! The great whore of revelation...<br>
<br>
The ten horns and the beast that you see will hate the adulteress, leaving her 
desolate and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire.<br>
<br>
When it comes to bundling Satan, your answer is [let go and increase popularity]<br>
<br>
In fact, I want to borrow the power of Satan. Add popularity to yourself, a guy 
who calls himself a prophet and Christ. To indulge evil and abuse the father in 
heaven for a little petty gain. It&#39;s fair play. Is your popularity so important?<br>
<br>
A good man sends out good from the good that is in his heart. The evil doer 
sends out evil from the evil that is in his heart. For the fullness of the heart 
speaks out of the mouth.<br>

Ge [extramarital affairs are not morally prohibited... Everyone&#39;s sexual 
satisfaction is as convenient as going to the toilet. Since there is no moral 
problem in going to the toilet... When meeting the opposite sex, both parties 
are willing to...]<br>
<br>
God, what is it called? Disgusting! How can you think of it? It&#39;s not how 
conservative I am. Sex is the crystallization of love and the upsurge of 
emotion. How could it be like going to the bathroom? Even those with hormone 
imbalance feel guilty. Do you have any? Of course not! Look at those animals in 
pairs. Maybe you feel inferior?<br>
<br>
Imagine your Ge style Communist society. The male has lost the responsibility of 
being a father (I don&#39;t know who is his own baby); The mother is the director of 
the orphanage. The husband became a duck; The wife became a chicken. &quot;People&quot; 
wander between &quot;sex exchanges&quot;. Looking for their opposite sex prey. 
Intoxicated... Of course, it may promote people&#39;s exploration of the unknown. 
If; Why are animals more rational than people? More ethical? Confused. 
Exploring..<br>
<br>
The ignorant delight in folly; A wise man acts with integrity... Then people 
will say to the mountains, &#39;fall on us!&#39; Say to the hill, &#39;cover us!&#39;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ge style communism&quot; of fried rice<br>
<br>
At this time, you have changed from a theologian to a sociologist. The 
pediatrics theory [each according to his ability, and according to his needs] 
ignores human nature, and each according to his ability. Who should do the 
selling of coolies? Who should do the Department? Distribution according to his 
needs, which means food and clothing or senior villas? Who is responsible for 
the distribution? You deceive yourself and others. Your explanation is that 
[people will become] you have changed from a sociologist to an anthropologist 
again. Like Guevara, we should transform human beings. Transform people&#39;s 
thoughts. Turn people into Communist machines. Of course, they also have 
extramarital affairs.. In fact, your theory is plagiarized except for the gender 
issues that others dare not think of or say..<br>
<br>
What has been, will come again; What has been done must be done later. There is 
nothing new under the sun. Is there anything about which a man can say, this is 
new? However, in our previous generation, it already existed.<br>
<br>
Ge [&quot;I am God. Listen to him.&quot; He refers to ge Yimin]<br>
<br>
Typical nonsense! I used to think you were a lost lamb and didn&#39;t know what you 
were doing. Actually, you know exactly what you are doing. Clear purpose. Is to 
use the name of Christ to achieve their own goals. You are not the highly 
narcissistic guy I mentioned before. You know yourself very well. I just want to 
be famous. I am crazy, abnormal and out of control. Of course, there are still 
ambitions, but they are getting farther and farther away from their goals. More 
and more distant. Except for a few loyal vests, they all left and saw through. 
How meaningful are people examining themselves and arguing with you?<br>
<br>
Whatever you have, give it to him to make him rich; But whoever does not have, 
even what he has, will be taken away.<br>
<br>
Last warning!<br>
<br>
Stop calling yourself Christian. Please change your name to avoid the 
demonization of Christianity and hurting the innocent. The Bible is sacred. 
Don&#39;t quote scriptures casually to avoid retribution. Do not blaspheme the Holy 
Spirit for your own purposes,. The gains outweigh the losses. People should be 
responsible for their actions and pay for what they have done. Be alert! Fear!<br>
<br>
Therefore I say to you, all sins and blasphemies of a man shall be forgiven. But 
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven!<br>
<br>
This is my last time here.<br>
<br>
Here are almost all your vests. You continue to entertain yourself! God wants 
everyone to be saved, not one to fall. I hope you can repent! Kneel before God 
and confess your sins. Ask God for forgiveness with humility. God is kind and 
will forgive you. I&#39;m leaving. When I leave, I will stamp the dust off my feet 
to witness their wrongs.<br>
<br>
Do not give sacred things to dogs, nor throw your jewels in front of pigs, lest 
they trample on jewels with their feet and turn around to bite you.<br>

Lily&#39;s nanny put the fruit on her apple notebook. Lily said that the nanny 
became a fruit tray because of the apple logo.<br>
<br>
Lily has a house. In front of the house, she grows pepper. The neighbor says, 
&quot;your pepper is good, but it&#39;s a little spicy.&quot; Meaning stole the pepper of 
Baihe&#39;s family. Baihe posted a post, &quot;people have a time to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lily&#39;s grandmother was paralyzed in bed. Once her stool was on her body. The 
nanny wasn&#39;t there. Lily dealt with it. She posted a post &quot;stinks to death.&quot; I 
happened to deal with it for my father, just like me.<br>
<br>
There is a netizen whose ID is 666 at last. I said Satan, and Lily understood 
it, because 666 is the number of Satan in the Bible. This man, where Lily went, 
went there. He returned to Lily&#39;s post and became her loyal fan.<br>
<br>
After Baihe&#39;s post bar club was closed, I asked her to apply for a post bar 
owner. To apply for a post bar owner, she always had to post several posts to 
obtain the qualification. Baihe applied directly and was repeatedly rejected. I 
asked her to post a few posts first. She refused and said, &quot;volunteers also 
failed.&quot;<br>

Nerve 27 (III) 507. Little lily in the greenhouse: General Ge Yimin made a 
mistake (funny)<br>
<br>
General Ge Yimin, who has just returned from fighting in other forums, has come 
to Baidu Post Bar regardless of his physical fatigue. We continued to talk about 
his great Ge Gong thought with the netizens here. It was late that day. We said, 
&quot;general Ge, go back and have a rest. You just came back from narcissism in 
other forums. Keep your love body.&quot;<br>
<br>
General Ge Yimin shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s no problem. You know many people on the 
Internet now regard my Ge style theory as an enemy and keep making trouble for 
me. You are the future of the Ge Communist Party. You must adhere to 
extramarital love. This is a top priority.&quot; We were all excited with tears in 
our eyes. What a good Ge Yimin. He won&#39;t let go of other people&#39;s marriages...<br>
<br>
General Ge looked up at the sky and said, &quot;if only there were as many people who 
believed my lies as the stars in the sky.&quot; Suddenly, he became excited, his 
whole body trembled and his eyes shone. &quot;But there are such people who always 
find fault with me and want to mess up my thoughts and posts. They don&#39;t want 
extramarital love and don&#39;t accept my greed and deception. They are sinners.<br>
<br>
With these words, general Ge bent down, took off a smelly shoe from his feet, 
looked at the sky and said, &quot;damn heretics.&quot;<br>
<br>
He threw up his smelly shoes. The smelly shoe drew two perfect arcs in the air, 
and then fell down. &quot;These netizens who oppose me have been scolding me at GE 
Yimin&#39;s bar, including little lilies and birds. I&#39;ve endured it for a long time. 
I&#39;m almost crazy,&quot; general Ge Yimin said madly. Everyone clapped their hands and 
felt proud that there was such a madman in tieba.<br>
<br>
After his mood stabilized, general Ge asked, &quot;where did my smelly shoe fall just 
now? I was still barefoot,&quot; and &quot;it fell on a vest.&quot; Another vest said.<br>
<br>
General Ge Yimin was stunned and said, &quot;hurry to the hospital and see if there 
is any problem.&quot; Soon, news came from the hospital that he had been kicked open. 
With the invasion of harmful gas, he was in a coma....<br>
<br>
At this time, general Ge was still standing there with his bare foot and said to 
us, &quot;there is always a sacrifice to deceive the world. I can break the blood for 
my cult cause. They are big and glorious...&quot;<br>
<br>
He then bowed his head and said, &quot;but I must admit that I was too reckless to 
throw my smelly shoes up. I apologize to the waistcoats here. I explain the 
situation to the netizens of the post bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
We burst into tears. What a good Ge Yimin! He remembered his small mistakes in 
the struggle with just Internet users and apologized. We must learn from general 
Ge in our future posts, learn from his mind of meaningless justice and his 
spirit of never giving up.<br>
<br>
At this time, a sound like an evil wind passing through a broken window came 
from the direction of the hospital: &quot;the east wind blows and the war drums beat. 
If you don&#39;t believe Ge Yimin, who else do you want to believe...&quot; &quot;Eh? Where is 
my front tooth...&quot;<br>

was far away in La Coruna, Western Spain, to participate in the Teresa Cup 
warm-up match, denied this: &quot;when he (Ronaldo) was in shape, he was undoubtedly 
a champion, but at this stage he is not Milan&#39;s goal.&quot; Ancelotti even joked with

Nerve 27 (III) 756. Vast crowd: Ge Shenxian is a little strange<br>
<br>
It&#39;s &quot;it&#39;s difficult to know whether Ronaldo will transfer to Milan or Real 
Madrid. Who is lying - Netease sports&quot; (the original page has been olive) in the 
nerve news, because this news mentioned the earliest version of Ge Shen&#39;s 
&quot;nerve&quot; called &quot;the yeme Sutra&quot;. Moreover, the Italian coach Ancelotti said that 
&quot;the Italian sports newspaper, like other Italian or Spanish newspapers, is not 
the yeme Sutra after all.&quot; Is this a coincidence? (according to ge Shen, the 
Yemei Sutra is the nerve, the earliest version of the nerve. An Shuai 
exemplifies the nerve, which means that everyone in the audience knows it. 
Otherwise, others won&#39;t understand it.)<br>
<br>
The original news release time was 11:35:06, August 14, 2006. At this time, 
geyimin was only a little famous in the domestic Christian circle and could not 
be known by foreigners. Moreover, Ge Shen also sent the news screenshots to his 
God website. According to the page save, he also found that GE Shen has not been 
processed. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t know the P-map at all. For this strange news, 
since then, there has been a plastic product (suspected to be the alias of Ge 
Shen), which can also be said to be self directing and self acting. He sent an 
article to list a few criticisms of Ge Shen, Among them, there is a question 
about the authenticity of this news: &quot;my English is not good. If there are 
brothers and sisters who have good English, search the English version of the 
news. If the English version is written in the Bible, that is, the coach of 
Serie A did not mention the yeme Sutra at all, but just the Mistranslation of 
the Netease editor (some sisters said to buy it).&quot;<br>
<br>
The News Publisher is fangzhongxin, who served as Netease sports special article 
from 2006 to 2007. If it is a mistranslation, it is possible. It is incredible 
to bribe.<br>

In the first picture, this passage is probably translated into sports daily 
instead of the Yemeni Sutra, while in the second picture, the Yemeni Sutra is 
translated into the Bible. The main difference lies in the word evangelio.<br>
<br>
Everyone is familiar with the word evangelio. Evangelio in the new century, that 
is, EVA, is the abbreviation of Evangelion. This word should be translated into 
the Gospels rather than the Yemenis.<br>

Nerve 27 (3) 833. Especially the nerve news, according to the judgment of bar 
friends, Yemei bribed Netease editors to tamper with the Bible as the Yemei 
Sutra, but it may not be. According to the discovery of a netizen, the original 
text is the Gospels, and Yemei probably knew that the original text could not be 
the Yemei Sutra but the Bible of Tencent News. She made a big fuss about the 
mistranslated version. She also said that the coach of the Yemei cult entered 
Milan, Italy talked about the Yemei Sutra, Yemei herself knew that other 
translations pointed to the Bible, but she still included the mistranslated 
version in the neuronews to comfort herself.<br>

All the translations of the original texts by major translation software are 
Gospels or Bibles. No matter how you say it, you can&#39;t turn to the Jeme Sutra. 
Maybe Netease editors know you and don&#39;t know what the original intention is. 
The bad thing is, as Paul said, the good thing is to publicize you in a 
different way. It is reasonable to say that Fang Zhongxin&#39;s email should be 
found soon, but this name is a star, and most of the search results are him. It 
is difficult to find the information of the editor with the same name. In 
addition, I have read other news of CITIC below, but there is no such thing as

Ziwei sage and wangzhe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2006, I first saw an article about the sage of crape myrtle in a forum. I 
thought it was a specific person and a personal name (for example, the online 
name was not convinced, because I wrote nerves in 2004). At that time, the 
prediction of 2012 was very popular. I was 2019. Someone replied to me on that 
forum: &quot;they all said those years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, I knew that I was a prophet, but there was no specific person, and I was 
rated as one of the top ten Saints (around 2010). I took the initiative to enter 
the saint circle and became a saint.<br>
<br>
List of the top ten saints: geyimin, zhengkuifei, Yu Zhanqi, maweiqing, 
xuanchangwei, Wang Weihao, Shu Zhangming, lvyongjun, Zhang Wuzhong and Wang 
Jianxin.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s why I pay attention to purple saint. There is also the reason why friends 
@ little lilies in the greenhouse. Pay attention to Chinese saints.<br>
<br>
In fact, before there was a bar owner (Solomon), he sent a post &quot;nerves&quot; and 
posted it with a machine. At that time, the post bar could send long articles at 
one time. How many layers would it be automatically divided into? I have about 
40000 words. Later, the bar owner told me that after deleting this post, he 
didn&#39;t go.<br>
<br>
Little Lily was deleted in the holy bar. She came to ge Yimin bar to complain. 
Then I entered the holy bar and even brushed the screen for a long time.<br>
<br>
I am a contemporary Christian Communist, and naturally I am a Christian circle 
and a communist circle. Nerves are also dominated by these two.<br>
<br>
In 2001, he went online, mainly in the Christian circle.<br>
<br>
I joined the online philosophy circle passively. The first time I saw the 
composite picture of the nine Internet philosophers&#39; avatars, I was the first 
picture (mentally retarded and barbaric), and I knew that I was an Internet 
philosopher:), passively entered the Internet philosopher circle.<br>
<br>
List of the nine online philosophers: Ge Yimin, Zhou Qun, Yun Jie, feather 
brother, keren2398, Zhao Kexun, LAN Zhi, Strongart, and Du Ren 13.<br>
<br>
Before the Chinese Saint bar, there were several Saint bars, which were 
repeatedly sealed and built. The &quot;saints&quot; can always gather new saint bars. 
There were back pushing pictures before, holding heaven and earth, Ziwei sage, 
Ziwei sage, etc. Then there are the Chinese sage bar, the world sage bar, the 
shijianqian bar, the headquarters bar, etc.<br>
<br>
I always keep Ziwei sage, Christianity, communism, Internet philosophy and folk 
Science in my screen bar, 8 in each bar, plus a few hot related bars. Constantly 
replace, but always brush the screen in about 40 bars.<br>
<br>
I have also done a lot of bar owners to publicize, while II is good at doing bar 
owners and changing materials to publicize Ge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary report of the ten-year holy bar: two basic estimates.<br>
<br>
1. It is estimated that my friend thinks he is the only sage of crape myrtle. 
Others are fake saints. Women also think they are saints, not saints.<br>
<br>
It is precisely because there is no real person in the virtual sage crape 
myrtle, which is calculated according to the prediction, resulting in this 
strange phenomenon.<br>

them are overt, have lived in hospital, few of them are recessive, have not been 
hospitalized, and even do not take medicine.<br>

Post bar screen brushing (I)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the past few years, I bought a top posting machine (tools and software) to 
automatically post my own theme posts in Tianya forum and Baidu Post Bar. As 
soon as I opened the tool, it would take turns to top posts and reply to the set 
paragraphs. In the Tianya forum, some netizens thought it was my manual top post 
and sent a post saying that I would not go to the home page.<br>
<br>
In Baidu thought bar, I wrote a nervous article, a large section, and then used 
tools to automatically post, which became a rare hot post in thought bar. The 
bar owner was embarrassed, because many bar friends had replied before and were 
reluctant to delete it. I saw that the reply was no longer top, and the link was 
removed from the tool.<br>
<br>
The post bar is suitable for me, because one number can post in all the post 
bars, and the bar owner can only seal up for 10 days at most. I have 150 
numbers, and take turns. The original ones have been unsealed early, while the 
circular closure is too troublesome. I have too many numbers, which is even more 
troublesome. Only later, a few of the main tools of the post bar can achieve 
automatic circulation ban, such as atheists.<br>
<br>
Swiping the screen means that more numbers are better. My number source: 1. 
Registered by myself; 2. Take the son&#39;s number, there are more than 20; 3. The 
netizen Huahan Longxing sent me dozens of numbers; 4. A small number bought with 
Paul; 5. A small number of bar friends sent them to the public. The number of 
disciple Paul was basically bought. He had 700 numbers in front of and behind 
him. He repeatedly sealed and bought them. He brushed the screen with a tool and 
basically sealed them.<br>
<br>
Of course, I swipe the screen for publicity. I copy neural content. I used to 
copy the posts commented by netizens on Shenwang, that is, click, copy and 
paste. Later, I directly copied neural TXT, that is, cut and paste.<br>
<br>
If there is no bar owner, I can swipe the screen. I am better at swiping the 
screen in the bar with a bar owner, because the bar with a bar owner is more 
popular. In the past, the bar owner was only able to delete one post per post, 
that is, click to open a post to delete it. I also sent one post per post. Once, 
the Chinese sage bar competed with me, and I sent him to delete it. But after a 
while, he posted a post and admitted that he was not as quick as me.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the bar owner will seal the IP, so I will send a post to disconnect 
the router and still finish swiping the screen.<br>
<br>
Later, baidu bar owners can delete a page of posts with one click, that is, the 
home page check box group can delete, so the screen can only be swiped in the 
bar owners.<br>
<br>
Later, baidu specifically targeted me. All my 150 numbers were banned and 
blocked, and all Ge Baobao&#39;s 700 numbers were killed in battle. The history of 
screen brushing came to an end, so I could only build a personal number to post. 
However, the number that advertised Ge was reported or found by the 
administrator to be blocked and blocked. So now, I can only build a personal 
number to secretly support Ge related posts sent by others. fifty-five thousand 
five hundred and fifty-five<br>

<br>
<br>
957. Prince and everyone: why does someone propagandize Ge Yimin and say that he 
is a heretical cult?<br>
<br>
In recent days, Ge Yimin party often came to the bar to break it. When breaking 
it, some people not only publicized him, but also spoke ill of him. This will 
make it difficult for the bar owner to distinguish the true and false posters. 
This will lead to the accidental deletion of Christian posts against him. 
Therefore, Christians should not comment on him, so that the bar owner can block 
his information when he sees it.<br>

Ge Hua, if you don&#39;t want to be defined as an evil cult, like other evil cults, 
you will be attacked by the state and flee to foreign countries. You will end up 
with no one alive and no body dead. You will continue to kill versions every 
day!<br>
<br>
In the past, I didn&#39;t think you were disgusting when I was a child in Huaxia 
bar, but it&#39;s really disgusting to see you slaughtering a few posts like a swarm 
of locusts crossing the border in recent months! Annoying!<br>

<br>
Oh. By the way. He has a bunch of hackers backstage to see who is unhappy.<br>

The point is that so many people still believe in him.<br>

Ge Sheng, do you have any contact information? Posting bar is OK, but I heard 
that you have been banned from the whole network. Maybe there is no posting bar.<br>

According to the law of one, the bar service is forbidden for ten days. For

<br>
Apart from other things, it&#39;s just a God&#39;s stick. But the only thing that makes 
me curious is that his endurance has been preaching God&#39;s religion all over the 
Internet, such as twitter, YTB, Facebook, a follower, and even the Hong Kong 
Forum. It has been preached almost all over the wall, and it&#39;s been preaching 
and brushing the screen every day. He has worked hard to preach the gospel. 
However, few people have come to see it. It can be said that God&#39;s propaganda 
has failed.<br>

<br>
St. Jerome&#39;s behavior is even worse. In the early days of surfing the Internet, 
he often touched porcelain everywhere in the Christ bar or forum, and kicked the 
Christ bar owner off his own stage. The Bible has also been changed into the 
Jerome Sutra. Even though they have their own websites, they still post crazily 
in major post bars, including Tianya, Douban and other platforms. Even though 
many accounts have been blocked, they are haunted on the network, and they have 
opened several vest crazy activities. Until recently, a plum black one by one 
jvbao has stopped. Jeremy himself called it evangelism.<br>

matter how hard he tried to brush the screen on major websites and post bars, 
according to him, at that time, every post bar posted posts, even including 
space materials. What happened? Just the opposite, he was blocked by the whole 
network. As long as he kept mentioning his friends in the post bar, it would be 
appropriate to be blocked if he was seen by the above one day. Hype, swipe the

3. Your content and means are too poor. Let the resident friends compare with

Influence ★★★★★★ the only one can&#39;t be found<br>
<br>
Educational background ★★★★★ before the expansion of enrollment in Nanjing 
University in the last century, scores can be cleared up<br>
<br>
Theoretical level ★★★★★★ has been published<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
627. Schlachtkreuzer: ask &quot;how to create your own meme&quot;<br>
<br>
It suddenly occurred to me today that the Internet philosophers represented by 
Chuang, Jie, bang and Shen seem to have done this. Even if they die in reality, 
their meme will continue to exist for a long time.<br>
<br>
Some people will excavate their oldest accounts and initial speeches. With the 
changes of times, they will find their first footprint in the Internet world, 
&quot;study&quot; every detail of their online life history in the past ten years, explore 
their &quot;original ecology&quot; when they do not know that someone is doing this to 
them, and conduct a cyber archaeology against a person with their own memory and 
the memory of the Internet.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, ordinary people really don&#39;t have this treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
702. Boundless crowd: make a talent ranking list for online philosophers.<br>
<br>
(it is reasonable to say that there should be an aunt, but the reasons that 
cannot be explained in detail cannot be counted. If they can be counted, they 
will be ranked third.)<br>
<br>
The first Ge Shen<br>
<br>
There is no doubt about this. For example, when he was in high school, there was 
a mid-term exam that ranked first in the county and won the second place in the 
school knowledge competition. In 1986, he won the second prize in the Zhenjiang 
high school essay competition. There was an algebra problem that only Ge Shen 
answered correctly in two classes. At the same time, his classmates evaluated 
him as &quot;knowledgeable&quot;. In addition, some of his literary works in those years 
were also very good. I like the Great Wall Fu, my mother and several works in 
high school. At the same time, he is also a graduate of Nanjing University in 
the 1980s, and his scores can go to Tsinghua University and Peking University. 
That is, his thought of &quot;Christian GC socialism&quot; is actually a little 
unrealistic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
825. Vast crowd: netzhe high-yield video ranking<br>
<br>
The fourth best song: Yimin<br>
<br>
Excluding the videos made by the TV chef, Yu Yuexing clam and Ge Baobao, only 
the videos of his daily life, self recorded neurology and hymns are counted. 
There are about 272 videos in total. Of course, he may continue to read them. 
The number of videos of geyimin is the best to check, mainly because they are 
backed up on the official website.<br>

Vulgar wiki entry: Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Geyimin (January 31, 1969 -), a native of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, has his 
wife huchunfang and son gebiao. He graduated from the Chinese language and 
Literature Department of Nanjing University in July, 1990, and participated in 
the first year of Pingcheng. He was a progressive youth at that time. Now he is 
the executive director of Zhenjiang weilik Machinery Co., Ltd. Ge Yimin calls 
his followers &quot;Ge Hua&quot;. According to the estimation of elegant people, they are 
actually a very limited number of middle-aged women. Elegant people also call 
themselves &quot;Ge Hua&quot; when they interact with them.<br>
<br>
On july7,2017, after the site was blasted by the ocean of human debris village, 
Ge Yimin backed up this entry on his website.<br>
<br>
At the request of Ge Yimin, the template for stopping persecution was removed. 
This is because Ge Yimin has long held the view that &quot;Ge Hei is also Ge Hua&quot; and 
believes that abusing himself is also a form of fame. It can be seen that some 
netizens who like to hype their negative popularity are on a par with Ge Yimin.<br>

Vulgar wiki entry: Ge Yimin (II)<br>
<br>
Travel transmission<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin claimed that he could pick up the cactus and drink the urine of a 
7-year-old neighbor girl when he was 3 years old.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin claimed to be &quot;anointed as a God&quot; in the autumn of 2001 and became a 
&quot;Christian Communist Internet religious thinker&quot;. It is actually a serious 
psychopath who has been active on the Internet for a long time. Its baidu 
account (now permanently sealed) was later certified by Robin Lee, which is too 
wonderful and profound. He claimed that he was sentenced to prison in 2012. 
Later, he was asked by an elegant person to confirm that the news of &quot;sentenced 
to prison&quot; was an event fabricated by GE Yimin himself in order to hype his &quot;God 
Religion&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin published the book nerve at his own expense in september2014 [1]. His 
works can be included by the China HowNet [2], so it must be said that your 
country&#39;s academic achievements are rare.<br>
<br>
Dingtie dog your mother blew it up<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin uses major search engines to search his name all day long, which is 
exactly the same as Hou jusen. The salary and work content of the workroom are 
also amazing. It is not difficult to see from the &quot;nerves&quot; written by GE Yimin 
that GE Yimin&#39;s ultimate goal is to establish a cult like Quli and wantonly 
amass money and lust.<br>
<br>
On december16,2016, Ge Yimin copied and pasted the contents of this page to his 
personal website, Zhihu column [3], Douban and his personal post bar 
enlightenment bar and prophet bar. On december18,2016, Ge Yimin came to the 
Yaoye item comment area of our website and made a noble speech that human beings 
could not understand. Since the end of December 2016, Ge Yimin and his trumpet 
have been active in the pornographic dream Department Post Bar.<br>
<br>
On the evening of April 4, 2017, elegant people exposed their tragic reality in 
the religious group, such as &quot;as a director, the monthly salary is less than 
5000, and this job was found by his parents&#39; trust&quot;. Ge Yimin became angry and 
sent elegant people out of the group to study abroad. It perfectly shows that GE 
Yimin dare not face the reality. At 22:29 on May 28, 2017, Ge Yimin transferred 
the group to a manager. On may30,2017, Ge Yimin retired from the group, saying 
that &quot;this group has nothing to do with me&quot; and &quot;there is a generation gap with 
your young people&quot;, but after persuasion, he rejoined the religious group.<br>
<br>
In 2018, Ge Yimin began to broadcast nerves on various short video platforms. 
Specifically, his micro vision number: geyimin<br>
<br>
This person once created his own Baidu Encyclopedia entries, but now it has been 
olive. Whenever someone asked Ge Yimin to show a miracle or prove that he was a 
God, he would sophisticate with the &quot;nerve&quot; and the things he saw in his dream, 
which is really homesick.<br>
<br>
On april21,2019, Meng Chi accidentally found Ge Yimin&#39;s microblog and put it up 
for criticism. Then he attracted yuekaiwen and some rabbit generals to watch. 
The possibility of Ge Yimin&#39;s rise is slim.<br>
<br>
Meng Tan<br>
<br>
One day at the end of April, due to the influence of Meng Tan, Ge Yimin was 
banned from the whole network. His name has been listed in sensitive words on 
websites such as tieba Weibo, and none of his accounts survived. He immediately 
enjoyed the treatment of national leaders, ranking far ahead of other online 
philosophers.<br>
<br>
At around 8:00 p.m. on April 14, 2020, Ge Yimin was brutally checked for the 
fourth time because Shen Bi pretended to be Ge Yimin at the condiment forum. 
During this period, he encountered fingerprint blood samples and became a 
sensitive person. Later, Ge Yimin confessed that he could not continue to fight 
and only changed to cultural direction.<br>
<br>
Holy household<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, like Zhang Jie, likes to flirt with Liu Yifei, and his use of words 
goes beyond that.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin and his wife huchunfang were married through arranged marriage, and 
there is not much emotional foundation between them. In 2018, huchunfang 
suffered from ovarian cancer. At this time, Ge Yimin, who pretended to be a God, 
could not afford to pay for the treatment. He had to raise money online. It is 
conceivable that the results were poor. A kind-hearted person advised Ge Yimin 
to give him money as long as he admitted that he was not God. Ge Yimin still 
clamored that &quot;Jesus&#39; family also suffered from birth, old age, illness and 
death&quot;. Later, Ge Yimin was really unable to survive. He said in plain clothes 
that &quot;God also has difficulties&quot; to beg, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s too late.<br>

Tianya&#39;s management deleted the seal for the crime of heresy? His followers are 
still active in Baidu. Is it the superior&#39;s request to delete the seal, or does 
Tianya management decide by itself? Baidu Post Bar Ge Yimin related posts are 
sent normally.<br>
<br>
Tianya community is so patriotic. Just after Ge Yimin was sentenced, he deleted 
all Ge Yimin related posts and cancelled all Ge flower IDs. Dozens of Ge Yimin 
related posts in my favorites were deleted. They were basically high-rise

been cancelled: St. Yemei exposes the network novel dark song Yimin, willykye

Mom, where is uncle Ge Yimin? Jiangsu second prison! After the first instance, 
Ge Yimin did not appeal, and the first instance judgment came into effect. Ge 
Yimin has been imprisoned in Jiangsu No. 2 prison (East Gate of Zhenjiang) for 
seven years, and will be released on September 10, 2019. It happened to verify 
the prediction of new heaven and new earth in early October 2019 in nerves. 
Nerves 19. Ge Yimin is the proof of God 13. 2019, the world will realize a 
communist society.<br>
<br>
The God who was executed by the government in three years of preaching is called 
Yesu. To tell you a word, the God who was executed by the government in three 
years of preaching is called Yesu, and the beggar who was a prince is called 
Sakyamuni. All the right ways are like this, while the evil way, as long as you 
persist, will not be more harmful than offering sacrifices to evil gods. As soon 
as society changes and moves, you people will be the first to be overthrown and 
slaughtered. Besides, I think you are really liars. As for Mao, he has been 
shaped into a God by the government. Up to now, his evaluation in textbooks and 
the media is all positive, and he continues to brainwash people. Think of God Ge 
Yimin, a little god of this level, who has been arrested and imprisoned. There 
are believers supporting him in this version, not to mention God Mao? The 
consequence of official brainwashing is to create a large number of brainless 
people. When you say bad things about Mao Zedong, he jumps out and beats you. If 
you ask him what&#39;s good about Mao Zedong, he can&#39;t even think of it.<br>

Killing Father, wife and mother to guess riddles is the highest realm of life. 
Ge Yimin can&#39;t kill father, wife and mother. Sorry. What GE Yimin wants to do is 
to guess riddles. Is there a God? Nowhere is everywhere, not convincing. Where 
is God? Heaven cannot be proved. What does God want us humans to do? It is 
better to believe in Satan than to believe in him. At least Satan gives me 
wisdom.<br>

When GE Yimin was 3 years old, he wanted to find the elixir of immortality from 
the cactus or some herbs. When I was 3 years old, I saw the cactus on the house 
and wondered if it would make me immortal after eating it in the back of the 
house or in the vegetable field. I wondered if there was any herb or vegetable 
that could make me immortal after eating it<br>

When GE Yimin was 3 years old, he drank the urine of a 7-year-old girl. When I 
was 3 years old, I didn&#39;t know why. My neighbor, Meng Meng, was 7 years old, had 
a pee in front of my house. It happened to be in a broken bowl. I waited for her 
to leave and took it up. I don&#39;t know why today<br>

coupon also allowed me to save money many times. The space was soon stable. I 
decided to freeze the website on Alibaba cloud. Alibaba cloud, I have built four

The shenanigans disdain to conceal their views: in the future communist society, 
everyone has normal married children, and their extramarital affairs are not 
morally prohibited. In the future communist society, any adult man or woman can 
go to Wushan together if both sides are willing. This behavior is not morally 
prohibited, and mankind is completely blessed and harmonious. We need to build 
as many sex exchanges as toilets. Any adult male or female can enter as long as 
they need it. If they meet the opposite sex and both sides are willing, it can 
be a gift of the Duke of Zhou. Everyone&#39;s sexual satisfaction is as convenient 
as going to the toilet. Since there is no moral problem in going to the toilet, 
there is no moral problem in going to the sex exchange. The behavior without 
victims is moral. Eunuchs also want palace maids. Why not meet human nature? It 
can solve many crimes, and many people feel helpless and painful. Sex is God&#39;s 
blessing to human beings and animals, so it can reproduce. Everyone&#39;s sex is 
completely liberated and free, and human sex enters the kingdom of freedom. 
Sexual freedom does not necessarily lead to promiscuity. For example, birds are 
sexual freedom, but there is no promiscuity. Animals are essentially sexual 
freedom, because there is no moral law restriction, no dictatorship machine 
punishment, no family, but there is no promiscuity and terrible disease. Sexual 
freedom only respects human rights. People are curious about crime because they 
are sneaky. Once they are free, it will be the same. Instead, people can treat 
it correctly and will not abuse sex, such as animals.<br>

&gt;About GE Yimin<br>
<br>
After verification, geyimin seems to be a so-called &quot;sect&quot; in Chinese Mainland, 
and he also calls himself Christ, which has attracted criticism from many people 
on the Internet. If so, the user geyimin&#39;s user name is obviously inappropriate, 
and it is recommended to seal it up.<br>

On january22,2019, an elegant person published a three T statement on qulunli&#39;s 
website in the name of &quot;Christian believer&quot; Ge Yimin. The statement said that GE 
Yimin had not paid party dues for more than 30 years and &quot;hoped that God would 
forgive me&quot;. Due to its elegant writing and wonderful and profound connotation, 
the statement was selected as the &quot;TD selection&quot; of &quot;XT TV station&quot; of qulunli 
media. It can be said that gongshifeng&#39;s prediction &quot;with you and me, I&#39;m on TV&quot;

Key politics represents the different positions of keyboard men. For example,

example, the great men elected by the political party during the election and 
then attack each other. Therefore, the representative of key politics is Ge

Yimin&#39;s mind, black powder and real powder are both powder and &quot;Ge Hua&quot;, which 
are worth publicizing. After the evil wiki hung him up and revealed his personal 
information, the man not only didn&#39;t get angry, but also asked the evil Wiki to 
add the label of &quot;accelerating persecution&quot;, and even backed up the information 
about the evil Wiki&#39;s debut on his own website.<br>
<br>
He wrote his own &quot;nerves&quot; with 600000 words, claiming to be more authentic than

<br>
Ge Yimin, a native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, published his autobiography 
nerve in the Hong Kong Publishing House. Later, his followers called him Ge Hua, 
who became active in the major religious spiritual post bars. There were no 
managed religious post bars airborne. Vulgar people made fun of Ge Yimin and 
called him Ge Shen. Ge Yimin is also an Unrated online philosopher in the 
Department of vulgarity, but some people call him an online philosopher. He 
likes to collect his comments on his website. At present, Ge Yimin is still 
active and makes a living by working.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin: at that time, the word &quot;Gym&quot; was banned in the post bar, which is a 
homonym used by gym.<br>
<br>
Ge Hua: gym&#39;s followers, but in fact many of them are false.<br>

Drinking tea (I)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first time I drank tea was in 2004. At that time, my Yemei network filed 
with the Ministry of industry and information technology and filled in my real 
name and address. Soon, the Zhengdong Road police station asked me to go. It was 
an afternoon. I really drank tea and made a cup of tea for me. Several people 
had a discussion with me. There were people from the Municipal Bureau or a 
Branch Bureau, people from the Religious Bureau, and a lady. She was very 
beautiful and good-natured.<br>
<br>
At that time, I was a popular member of Baidu tieba Christian network, and there 
were thousands of members in Yemei community. At that time, long li in Yemei 
community was still there. One specially said that long Li had posted many 
posts.<br>
<br>
Just let me talk about my thoughts. Being polite, I say I am a Christian 
Communist, and Christianity and communism are interlinked. One said that it was 
opposite. I don&#39;t need to tell him that communism originated from Christianity. 
It was Christian communism from the beginning (weitlin).<br>
<br>
This time, I talked about my thoughts and my website. There was nothing else to 
stop me. I was not allowed to do anything, nor did I interfere with my website. 
Someone made a record and finally asked me to sign. I also asked if I had been 
dealt with by the public security before. I said no, signed and went home.<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 694. When I was in Yemei community, I wrote a paragraph and went 
to dating websites, such as Yahoo, to make friends, search for women, and then 
paste them one by one without looking at their information. I invited many girls 
to the community, such as Wanqing. I also talked with the internet police and 
the Religious Affairs Bureau. I called it &quot;hair when you see a woman&quot;. They were 
also surprised. I said that making friends means that men make women, and women 
make men.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The second time I drank tea was a few years later. The cyber policeman found a 
room at my door. They asked me, and they were very polite. This time, I deleted 
the &quot;doomsday 2019&quot; in Yemei. He also asked himself: &quot;doomsday is 2019.&quot; &quot;Who 
said that?&quot; &quot;Said Saint Jeme.&quot; It seems that Saint Jeme is a celebrity with 
credibility.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Yemei community members, Lizi is the main force. I said she is from 
Yangzhou University and should be a party member.<br>
<br>
This time it was a talk. After that, I went home and deleted the article. I 
called the cyber policeman and he said yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After drinking tea for the third time, a few years later, the police station 
policeman came to my house in the evening and asked me to go to the police 
station the next day. I said I didn&#39;t commit a crime and didn&#39;t want to go. He 
said it was OK. If something happened, he wouldn&#39;t come alone.<br>
<br>
The next day I went to talk about my website and articles. I saw that the 
instructor had a folder with a go to chariot on the cover. This time, I was 
asked not to play the flags of &quot;Ge Yimin religion&quot;, &quot;Ge Yimin party&quot;, 
&quot;Shenjiao&quot;, &quot;Shendang&quot; and &quot;Christian Communist union&quot;. I agreed and deleted 
them on the website at that time, but soon I recovered and the internet police 
didn&#39;t bother any more.<br>
<br>
Registered residence police officer Chen Jun once came to my house in the 
evening. I was surfing the Internet. He operated my computer, opened Shenwang, 
and clicked the link &quot;Ge Yimin and Li Hongzi&quot;. I said I shouldn&#39;t mention him 
(LI). He said, &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter.<br>
<br>
Later, I played the music on the Jinshan mountain in Zhenjiang (zhouhaimei 
version) on the home page of Shenwang. One morning, I was at work. Chen Jun 
called me: &quot;Chairman Ge.&quot;<br>
<br>
He asked me the address of my new home. Several people went to the police 
station. My wife was at home. They turned on my computer and clicked Shenwang. A 
policeman said that the website costs dozens of yuan a month. My wife also 
warned them not to interfere with my website, saying it was my life.<br>
<br>
This time it&#39;s all right. Let me turn off the home music on the golden mountain 
in Zhenjiang. I&#39;ll turn it off.<br>

Drinking tea (II)<br>
<br>
Nerve 21 22. Ge Yimin&#39;s Adventures in the police station<br>
<br>
One day in november2019, the local police station summoned Ge Shen. I didn&#39;t 
take it seriously. The old guerrilla thought that the public security would 
start my official website again. I came straight to the point and said that I 
was dissatisfied with Comrade Deng Pufang&#39;s hard work to become rich. I think 
the former Comrade Deng Pufang was zhaoritan. The police should have read this 
article. Of course, I know that the main reason for summoning is a series of 
articles such as training into a pig. The police think it is human nature to 
seek profits for their children, and it is the same for you to be a senior 
official. The police always say &quot;Ge Yimin blog&quot;. My website has too much space. 
It took me a long time to know that it refers to my blog on the official 
WordPress website. The instructor introduced himself and said that I graduated 
from Nanjing University. I am a literate and have a good level. Let me record 
it. It&#39;s OK.<br>
<br>
The place where the video is recorded is the interrogation room. The walls are 
covered with a thick layer of rubber, for fear that the suspect will crash into 
the wall and commit suicide. Sitting on the square chair, I had some equipment, 
but of course I didn&#39;t. The policeman was sitting opposite. There was a computer 
on his desk. He was typing and recording while asking questions. Of course I 
made an impassioned statement. I acknowledge China&#39;s economic development, but 
the gap between the rich and the poor is too wide. I am a communist. The police 
said you were for someone poorer than you. The Communist Party aims to win power 
for the poor. Now the Communist Party is no longer fighting for the poor, but 
only to protect and improve its own interests of being richer than the people. 
Now it&#39;s Ge Yimin&#39;s turn to fight for the poor.<br>
<br>
Ask me if I still write? When I said yes, the policeman was surprised and said, 
&quot;still writing?&quot;, I said to write normal articles, no longer sensitive. The 
police routinely say that the Internet is not an extrajudicial place.<br>
<br>
After the video recording, let me write something and give praise to the party 
and the government. Unlike Comrade liwenliang, he signed the admonition book. I 
wrote &quot;a little of my thoughts&quot; on white paper. Naturally, it is divided into 
three paragraphs. One paragraph praises the economic achievements of the party 
and the government, one paragraph says that I am not organized, and one 
paragraph says that writing online articles may mislead people. I went back to 
delete it and promised not to write similar sensitive articles.<br>
<br>
The police took it to the instructors and said that they all praised me for my 
level and good three-stage score. Some people can&#39;t write or segment. I thought 
it was over, but another short fat man in civilian clothes said to go through 
the formalities.<br>
<br>
The short and fat man took a picture of me first. He stood by the high-level 
wall with both sides, and took 4 pictures with the camera.<br>
<br>
Then I collected the palmprint of my hands, palms and each finger, and 
repeatedly pressed and rotated them on an electronic screen, tossing and turning 
for a long time.<br>
<br>
Then I signed my name on several pieces of paper and pressed my fingerprints. 
Unexpectedly, I saw that there were &quot;criminal facts&quot; written on the paper, which 
was the format of the Public Security Bureau.<br>
<br>
In addition, let me copy the phone numbers of 10 people in my mobile phone 
address book.<br>
<br>
I thought it was over. I wiped my hands with a paper towel. The fat dwarf asked 
me to wash my hands. I said no, he said there were still procedures.<br>
<br>
I washed my hands and came back. Like a nurse, the short fat man took out the 
Dongdong for blood collection. I knew it was to collect God&#39;s DNA. I immediately 
realized that no one in Ge Yimin&#39;s holy family could commit a crime. Ge God&#39;s 
DNA entered the big data of the public security.<br>
<br>
I know I can&#39;t resist, because the result of resisting the &quot;subpoena&quot; package is 
the following three packages: &quot;detention&quot;, &quot;imprisonment&quot; and &quot;shooting&quot;. 
Comrade liwenliang also knows that, so he signed &quot;can&quot; and &quot;understand&quot; on the 
admonition book.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 34<br>
<br>
Drinking tea (III)<br>
<br>
Nerve XXI 23. Four packages of summoning, detention, imprisonment and shooting 
are too heavy for life<br>
<br>
At around 8:00 p.m. on April 14, 2020, I was surfing the Internet at home. My 
wife and children were at home. Suddenly, four policemen came to me. One of them 
was young and dressed like a policeman. The other three men were dressed in 
civilian clothes and looked more like bandits. One was still wearing sunglasses, 
and the other was holding a law enforcement instrument. He had been 
photographing me.<br>
<br>
I said that liwenliang was just named a martyr, and you came again. The police 
wanted to take away my computer host. I asked, &quot;do you have any certificates?&quot; 
The young policeman took out a blank search warrant with seal and said it could 
be filled in now. I said it was unnecessary. I have to go myself. What can I do 
when a family of three is at home and faces four policemen (three of whom are 
&quot;bandits&quot;)---- Go with them.<br>
<br>
Get on the police car, tell me to sit in the middle, and the one with the law 
enforcement instrument sits on my right, and keeps taking photos. When he got to 
the police station, the policeman said he didn&#39;t need to take any more photos 
before he stopped.<br>
<br>
The grassroots police in the police station can interrogate thinkers. I said I 
didn&#39;t commit a crime. Police a said I was guilty of improper speech. Did the 
criminal law have the crime of improper speech? Police officer a said there were 
public order regulations. Did I say there were public order regulations? Police 
a hesitated. Police B threatened that the confession was different from the 
subsequent investigation.<br>
<br>
Police a suggested that it was the first time that I heard of the &quot;three mouth 
product&quot; of green onions in the &quot;green onion forum&quot;, and denied that I had 
posted a post on it. Police a said that we would not contact you twice for one 
thing. What have you sent since last time? I know that the internet police will 
read my post. After thinking about it, only two tweets are &quot;inappropriate&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ask what wall climbing software, I said misty; Who gave it? Post bar friends; 
Name? He has many online names and often changes. I didn&#39;t say, and I really 
can&#39;t say which ID he corresponds to. He registered to buy n multi ID post bar.<br>
<br>
The police asked me for twitter, Facebook, wechat, QQ and other accounts and 
passwords. I used the Internet with my real name and was open and aboveboard. 
Although I knew that the police had infringed, I still gave it, but I had many 
passwords. I wrote them on the computer and in my notebook, and some of them 
were inaccurate.<br>
<br>
I said I was a communist. I had only one idea. All the poor people should live 
better. Police B said it was impossible.<br>
<br>
Police officer a asked if anyone contacted me. This means that the overseas 
democracy movement has organized. He said that it may not be important to you, 
but it is important to us. He wanted to dig a big case. However, Ge Yimin has 
been fighting alone for 20 years since he went online in 2001.<br>
<br>
Police a said, &quot;a single spark can start a prairie fire. &quot;You can start a 
prairie fire. It was not these two tweets that summoned me. Thousands of people 
said similar words on the Internet. The government was afraid that GE Yimin&#39;s 
doctrine would start a prairie fire.<br>
<br>
Police a said that you should not accept advice just because you are here. Tell 
me your point of view, but I talk about my thoughts. Do you understand? When a 
scholar meets a soldier, he cannot explain why. If Lu Xun is interrogated by the 
Kuomintang reactionary grassroots police, what can he say? What could Jesus do 
in the face of the soldiers&#39; ridicule, whipping and insult--- On the cross.<br>
<br>
There are some big ones. For example, Mr. Zhao called and asked about his 
attitude. He also said that he had Nanjing opinions. I saw the script list of 
police a, &quot;4.15&quot; national security day and so on.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s write a letter of repentance, I wrote 64 students, long-term prejudice 
against the party and the government, although acknowledging the economic 
achievements of the government. The knot is over. No longer involved in 
politics, turn to culture and literature. After the police watched it, police B 
took a small video camera and asked me to read it again to record it.<br>
<br>
At the end of the trial, I came out to the waiting room. I saw that there were 
four confined rooms in half of the room. Let me go in and wait. I asked the 
police how long it would take. I said 20 minutes. A plain clothes man said that 
the common people should not talk about politics. Do you deserve to talk about 
politics? &quot;I guess he would jump up and hit me. I said go to the bathroom, he 
said you go. Come back, I asked if I locked it? He couldn&#39;t say, so I went in 
and sat down for a while.<br>
<br>
Take off the computer host and mobile phone, and write on the deduction slip 
that the mobile phone should be available to me tomorrow. Police a drove me home 
and just saw my wife and children coming to me at the door.<br>
<br>
After work the next afternoon, I went to get back my computer and mobile phone.<br>
<br>
On the afternoon of the third day, police a asked me to go. A civilian who 
didn&#39;t know whether the branch or the Municipal Bureau came to pick up some of 
my materials and told me to report to Nanjing or something.<br>
<br>
And let me collect fingerprint blood samples. What is the charge of collecting 
casual clothes? Policeman a thought for a while and said that he had fabricated 
false information to disrupt social order.<br>
<br>
This time, I also collected the mobile phone card, that is, I took down the 
mobile phone card in my little apple, put it into an instrument, and collected 
information into the computer.<br>
<br>
Knowing that the police have violated your human rights, you can do nothing 
about it. Summoning, detaining, jailing and shooting four packages is an 
unbearable burden of life.<br>
<br>
I cannot go to the cross like my second brother Jesus, because I have a wife and 
children; I can&#39;t go into exile like my third brother Sisi, because I love China 
and I want to change it; I can&#39;t really go crazy like the fourth younger brother 
Caicai and live a useless life.<br>
<br>
I, Ge Yimin, can only change the cultural direction and continue to write about 
my nerves. I do not know that there is a Han Dynasty, regardless of the Wei and 
Jin Dynasties.<br>

Nerve 12 163. Chongta is not strategic about the divine religion. Ge Shen 
repeatedly chongta, resulting in the cancellation of the filing of all domain 
names by the Ministry of industry and information technology, and the domestic 
host can no longer be used. The two domain names (godjiao.com geyimin.com) have 
been blocked one after another. Domestic access is not available, and the cause 
of the divine religion has suffered heavy losses.<br>

Reason for banning: X banning 11 [Rules for number deletion by independent 
request] the user actively requests the administrator to cancel<br>
<br>
Administrator handling (no login + hide all speeches): X ban 11 [Rules for 
deleting numbers independently] the user actively requests the administrator to 
log off. &quot;Are you the administrator of this site? The account I use has posted 
my personal information on his twitter because he was drinking tea. If you 
continue to use this account, there will be a risk of exposure. Can you help me 
log off this account? The one with no name left?&quot;.<br>

》Fake Ge Yimin: I am 51 years old, working in China, preparing to immigrate next 
year. It is well-known in China, but it has been banned in China because of 
oneortwo bad words about P. Recently, it has been reported by the domestic pink 
that there is no information left, so Nu Lai pin C feels the air of freedom of 
speech. I have experienced events in 84 years, and my blog has recorded them.<br>

There is too little information on this page. It is recommended to update the 
latest records from ebari. By the way, this man has eaten Zhao&#39;s eggs for 
abusing 200 people for many times. Let&#39;s send them directly to the Yingling 
hall.<br>

badly hurt.<br>

》Yexue: six, I&#39;m not afraid of Zhao&#39;s bullet, but chongta affects the deity, and 
the nerve also writes that chongta doesn&#39;t have a strategy, which affects our 
website. For example, cancel the filing of the Ministry of industry and 
information technology, and wall our domain name.<br>

What do you think? People think you are either fifty cents or sick<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin 15:59:38, September 7, 2021<br>

Wumao, a communist, has made it clear.<br>

Ge Yimin 16:00:26, September 7, 2021<br>

Your story overlaps with that of the cat. Nobody likes to see you. As for Ge 
Hua, I don&#39;t touch politics<br>
<br>
Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:01:10<br>

But after the Pinke thing happened, people took you as a God<br>

Where is the great God?<br>

Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:01:59<br>

Persecution, subpoena<br>

Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:02:40<br>
<br>
But someone pretended to be you first<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin 16:03:35, September 7, 2021<br>
<br>
In the past, the main idea was that the pretender just called the mysterious man 
ugly, and there was no substance.<br>
<br>
Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:03:55<br>
<br>
In fact, as long as you don&#39;t touch it, it&#39;s OK<br>
<br>
Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:04:32<br>
<br>
If you turn around outside the wall, you will be treated as a psychosis. It is 
an active repulsive force. It is unlikely to be targeted<br>
<br>

Don&#39;t rush the tower, do the website, will wall domain name, no strategy.<br>
<br>
Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:05:29<br>

I still remember your saying that you scolded the Shijian bar master. It was 
deemed to have been touched and you were completely blocked<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin 16:05:50, September 7, 2021<br>
<br>
Those who have stirred up trouble are all anti Communists. I am a communist, and 
of course I don&#39;t want to see them.<br>

<br>
What sentence?<br>
<br>
Gerpaul 2021/9/7 16:07:16<br>

The authorities don&#39;t like to see you either, but you haven&#39;t really acted.

remarks?<br>

But I didn&#39;t do much<br>

Gerpeter 19:12:11<br>

I said no<br>

Gerpeter 19:13:12<br>

Unless you don&#39;t post relevant content, something will happen sooner or later<br>
<br>
But at that time, I just doubted you, didn&#39;t I<br>
<br>
That&#39;s why you contacted me<br>
<br>
Later, some people spread rumors about this<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin 19:13:35<br>
<br>
It&#39;s OK, just don&#39;t rush the tower, culture<br>

Maybe it&#39;s for olives you and me<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin 19:14:32<br>
<br>
How did you spread the rumors?<br>
<br>
Gerpeter 19:15:32<br>

Someone asked me if you were organized<br>
<br>
I think someone might be spreading rumors every day<br>
<br>

Volume 6 Ge Shenyi Hearsay: the road to becoming a God(april2001 – present)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter I<br>
<br>
1. When I was young, I dreamed that I was lying in the open space in front of my 
house. A UFO circled overhead for a long time. My body could not move and had no 
power. I could only look at the UFO. I was a little panicked and wanted to shoot 
the UFO with a stone. It feels like it will fall on me. There is a strong light 
shining on me, giving me ability.<br>
<br>
2. When I was young, I slept on the bed in my dream. A ghost (Satan) approached 
me. He was a man in black. He was very scared. He got on the bed and attached 
himself to my body. He got up and left again. I looked at it in the nearby air.<br>
<br>
3. In primary school, shortly after my grandfather died, I dreamed that my 
grandfather met me on the river near the village. He seemed to be floating on 
the river and told me that he was not dead. I saw him on the Bank of the river. 
I was very happy. It turned out that he was still alive, and I immediately felt 
free from death.<br>
<br>
4. I started listening to Hong Kong&#39;s good friend evangelical channel in primary 
and junior high schools. The program that I felt warm, liked and impressed was 
desert sweet spring. That&#39;s the radio my father bought with the money he made in 
the sand factory. My mother often plays it to me.<br>
<br>
5. When I was in high school, I dreamed that I had defeated the Antichrist -- 
the European countries, which were contacted or captured by GE Yimin, were 
pushed back and forth on the map like a ground puzzle, and finally all belonged 
to ge Yimin.<br>

Peking University, going abroad, Nobel Prize in literature, mass organizations, 
unifying the world.<br>
<br>
He was 16 years old.<br>
<br>
6. 1986-90, Department of Chinese, Nanjing University, not working hard, trying 
to break into the society. During this period, I went to Nanjing Jinling 
Theological Seminary and heard the names of my brothers and sisters. I felt 
fascinated and heartbroken. When I graduated, I wrote in the message book that I 
believed in Christianity. At the class graduation party, when one person said 
something, I suddenly said, &quot;God bless us!&quot;.<br>
<br>
7. 1990-2000, assigned to Jiangsu agricultural means of production company and 
settled in Zhenjiang. We recognize the existence of God from the fact that there 
must be a craftsman for the implement, the cause for the fruit (the first 
cause), the first push of Newton&#39;s divine arm, and the existence of non-material 
&quot;vitality&quot;. After reading two biblical stories, I was immediately attracted to 
the Bible on New Year&#39;s Day 2000. I thought it was God&#39;s word, so I believed in 
God.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of 1992, the trial shouted, &quot;the kingdom of heaven is near, you 
should repent.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the autumn of 1998, the Bible story.<br>

8. 2001, online evangelization (making websites and forums).<br>
<br>
In april2001, I dreamed that the Apostle Paul was sailing to the city of San 
Paolo in Brazil in the Southeast Asian waters, preaching back and forth. God 
made me like him. (GE Yimin was called to be a prophet)<br>
<br>
9. In the autumn of 2001, Ge Yimin took a nap in his big bed at his home in 
Zhenjiang. In a dream, God said, &quot;I am God. You should listen to him.&quot; He 
immediately woke up and felt magical about &quot;pointing to ge Yimin&quot;, when his wife 
and children were at home. Ge Yimin was anointed as God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter II<br>
<br>
Nerve 10 152. Ge Yimin was born a communist, or he was born for communism.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said that when I was a boy, I could see that I was born a communist, 
even if I was not an outstanding communist soldier (thief).<br>
<br>
I want to build communism. Make it simple. All the poor people can live a better 
life. I don&#39;t want to enjoy it personally. I just want to keep my personal 
material life basic.<br>
<br>
（1） , boy<br>
<br>
1. When I was 3 years old, I wanted to find the elixir of immortality from the 
cactus or some herb. When I saw the cactus in the house, I wondered whether it 
would be immortality after eating it. In the back of the house or in the 
vegetable field, I wondered if there was any herb or vegetable that I ate to be 
immortality.<br>
<br>
This is the origin of nerves.<br>
<br>
2. When I was in kindergarten, I stole a knife from a primary school student 
with Zhu Dehong. Twice, I said I picked it up. My grandfather didn&#39;t believe it.<br>
<br>
（2） , Dingcun primary school<br>
<br>
1. Jurong County mathematics competition, to the county seat to participate, 
take the bus, feel very comfortable, the pleasure of speed, steal the same house 
compass.<br>
<br>
2. I don&#39;t understand that I have to repay money borrowed from relatives.<br>
<br>
3. Join the red soldier and put on the red scarf.<br>
<br>
4. I took a nap at the same table. Tai Juan&#39;s brother Tai Changjiang had a bunch 
of waste keys. I touched them for a long time. He was asleep. I wanted to steal 
his waste keys.<br>
<br>
（3） , Dazhuo junior high school<br>
<br>
1. He joined the Communist Youth League at the end of the period.<br>
<br>
2. When I was in junior high school, I gave myself a pseudonym: yuwenxiu (show 
of cosmic Literature) and Mr. Zhongtu, who had the desire to create literature. 
I don&#39;t know where many couplets come from. I have created many couplets.<br>
<br>
（4） , Jurong high school<br>
<br>
1. Passing by a small Christian Church, I felt very sacred.<br>
<br>
2. He created a couplet for Fu: &quot;at sunrise, all things in Shandong are warm and 
warm, and the grass and hair moon has been shining around the world since 
heaven.&quot; it was posted on the blackboard newspaper of the class. Zhangqinghe, an 
English teacher, said it was strong.<br>
<br>
（5） , Nanjing University<br>
<br>
1. I once rode a bicycle back to Jurong&#39;s hometown from Nanjing. I didn&#39;t know 
how to be brave. In order to save energy, I held a tractor in one hand and 
suddenly crossed a big slope. I even turned the car and people over to the other 
side of the road. When I woke up, a truck stopped in front of me. I got up and 
rode again. Nothing happened. It was just the opposite direction. When I found 
that the scene was familiar, I asked passers-by again and said that the 
direction was the opposite. I reversed my direction and rode back. Now I think 
this is definitely the care of God.<br>
<br>
（6） Agricultural materials of Jiangsu Province<br>
<br>
1. He worked for a short time. On December 14th, 1990, for the sake of the 
world, the society and the society, Ge Yimin entered the great trial, half 
prison and crucified. (electroacupuncture, later the God cult Good Friday)<br>
<br>
In order to save the world, Ge Yimin died on December 21 and was resurrected 
with the blessing of God. He defeated the poison hook of death and brought hope 
to the world. (electroconvulsive, later sacred Easter)<br>
<br>
2. Let Dongyan call me Christ, so I bought her chocolates or newspapers. She 
called me many times. He promised to buy guohongmei a mobile phone when he 
became a Christ. She called many times: &quot;buy me something.&quot; I have not yet 
refused as Christ.<br>
<br>
（7） Nerve diaries 24. (high school) last night, we blew communism. I used to say 
I didn&#39;t believe it. I felt sad that I had done something wrong. But now I think 
it is also a science and a religion. Like Christianity, capital is also the 
Bible. A person should be aboveboard and aboveboard when he is not born to do 
big things. Why should he be bound by others? Marx hasn&#39;t met yet. Why do you 
believe in him? I can say: not believing in communism is just like not believing 
in Christianity, but it&#39;s just a matter of justice. However, some people say 
that the horse is swollen when they see the camel. Their mouth and heart are 
different. They should believe it if they believe it. If they don&#39;t believe it, 
they should not force it.<br>
<br>
I think we should believe in ourselves, and I think people should: 1. Pursue the 
true meaning of heaven and earth; 2. Be innocent. We should have a foothold in 
the present, do what we do now, and talk about what kind of society we can live 
in. We can talk about the realization of communism one day, but one day the 
earth will explode. What else can we live in? Sad husband!<br>
<br>
（8） I was born a communist, and I have always been fond of Christianity. I 
bought the Bible on New Year&#39;s day in 2000. I just read the beginning. It fits 
my mind, so I believe in God. After surfing the Internet, I have been on 
Christian websites. Later, my disciple, the son of light, told me that communism 
originated from Christianity. I found that there was &quot;Christian communism&quot;, and 
I became contemporary Christian communism.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter III<br>
<br>
I have been a communist since I was a child (everyone is equal and material is 
equal), and I am still a communist thinker today.<br>
<br>
In 2004, my disciple, the son of light, told me that communism originated from 
Christianity. Due to well-known reasons, I had a conflict with communism, and 
the sophomore claimed in his diary that he did not believe in communism, just as 
he did not believe in Christianity. Paradoxically, my sophomore year in high 
school compared communism to Christianity and claimed that I didn&#39;t believe it. 
Many years later, I became a contemporary Christian communism.<br>
<br>
When I was in college, I only sent Christmas cards to Christianity, but I have 
been moved many times, and there is no external influence. No one preached the 
gospel to me (no one has preached the gospel to me so far). Let&#39;s be moved by 
the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Before surfing the Internet, he claimed to be the Christ, and insisted on 
letting the hair salon sisters guohongmei and Dongyan call me the Christ, even 
if he spent many times.<br>
<br>
In March2001, after surfing the Internet, I got the online name &quot;St. Jeme&quot;, 
which means holy, the Lord, Jesus, the last letter of Greece, Omega, and the 
meaning of God&#39;s last Messenger. I posted on Christian related forums and 
learned that Christ is the special name of Jesus, but I have my own thoughts, 
not only Jesus, but also the Bible. This is the biggest difference between me 
and Christians. They are limited to the Bible and Jesus, and dare not break 
through the Bible and Jesus.<br>
<br>
At that time, my official website was also called &quot;St. Jeme&#39;s Gospel website&quot;, 
and Han Mei and lengxue made a flash for me and hung it on the top of the home 
page: &quot;moved by the Holy Spirit, St. Jeme was able to preach the gospel to all 
the people in the world, so that all the people would return to the Lord!&quot; 
because he publicized his own ideas, he was regarded as a heresy by 
Christianity, criticized me, and deleted the title. However, I have read the Old 
Testament 9 times and the New Testament 18 times, more than most Christians.<br>
<br>
On may25,2002, Satan was driven out of my body by God in my dream.<br>
<br>
On June 29th, 2002, just falling asleep, half dreaming and half waking, I heard 
the voice of the Holy Spirit: &quot;it&#39;s going to be fast.&quot;.<br>
<br>
On August 27th, 2002, I was ascending to heaven on my alma mater Campus (Nanjing 
University) in my dream. The God said: &quot;I am God, you should listen to him&quot;, 
&quot;this is my beloved son, I am happy, you should listen to him&quot;, and a cloud came 
down, pointing to ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
On november14,2004, still in my dream, I climbed a high platform and opened a 
road to heaven on a broad platform. When Luton was shining, the road was 
horizontal, but a voice told me that it was to heaven, and a little girl 
witnessed it. A few days later, in a strange dream, the zenith opened a well 
like opening, with purple light shooting down like a waterfall. A few days 
later, in a strange dream, the sky was full of lights. No one could turn them 
on. Ge Yimin turned them on.<br>
<br>
On february15,2005, I had a class in my dream on the upper floor of Jiangsu 
provincial agricultural means of production office. Walking out of the sky from 
the third floor, there was a vast heaven. When I walked to the throne, the God 
pointed to ge Yimin and said, &quot;this is my beloved son, I am happy, you should 
listen to him.&quot; then I fell down to the street, and everyone watched, saying: 
&quot;this is a young man who has sinned against beauty.&quot;.<br>
<br>
On november20,2006, my dream was lifted for days in dashikou square, Zhenjiang. 
My body rose vertically in the air. Three days later, it was resurrected and 
lowered. Many people witnessed that the whole process was silent.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, I still post and interact in Christian forums, and I also post 
and publicize in major portal forums. On the other hand, I have made God&#39;s 
website and God&#39;s community. My official website is all my articles, which are 
dedicated to promoting my God&#39;s communist ideology.<br>
<br>
In 2012, I officially established the God Religion (geyimin God Religion), which 
has been registered for many years Com (abandoned by the wall and now used as 
gegod.com), which is a combination of Christianity and communism. In essence, it 
is contemporary Christian communism.<br>

<br>
Chapter IV<br>
<br>
About 2019<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1、 2019, in fact, I just went online to predict 2021. According to the Bible, 3 
is the beginning (soul) of mankind, and finally 7. 3*7=21, predicting the end of 
2021 (i.e. the 21st century).<br>
<br>
Later, I saw the prediction of the sabbath day meeting 1844 on the Internet. Of 
course, this prediction was not true, but his formula was used by me.<br>
<br>
》Nerve 2:10 &quot;remove the regular burnt offerings and set up the abominations of 
destruction&quot;, that is, the end of the theocratic regime. There is no tangible 
Kingdom on the earth to represent the theocratic rule, and all are ruled by 
Gentiles, that is, the subjugation of Judah.<br>
<br>
11. At the beginning of October 607 BC, the sovereignty of Judah had 
disappeared. Gedaliah, the governor of Judah appointed by the Babylonians, was 
assassinated, and all the remaining Jews fled to Egypt. (Jer. 40-43) reliable 
biblical chronological data show that this event occurred in early October of 
607 BC, 70 years before 537 BC (the year the Jews were released to return home). 
(Jer 29:10, Dan 9:2)<br>
<br>
So I checked the Scriptures and found:<br>
<br>
》8. Daniel 12:11-13: &quot;from the time when you take away the regular burnt 
offering and set up the abomination of destruction, there will be a thousand two 
hundred and ninety days. Blessed will be the man who waits for a thousand three 
hundred and thirty-five days. Go and wait for the end, for you will rest. At the 
end, you will rise and enjoy your blessing.&quot;<br>
<br>
9. The two dates have 2625 days in total. According to the law of &quot;one day for 
one year&quot; (God likes to punish people with one day for one year. Ezek 4:6: one 
day for one year; num 14:34: one year for one day.), This period is equivalent 
to 2625 years.<br>
<br>
13. So in 2019, the end of the world is coming. Ge Yimin is the king of God, 
ending the rule of foreigners and establishing the kingdom of God (Communist 
society).<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to the end of the world. In fact, I am looking forward to 
the early arrival of the new heaven and earth, that is, the Communist society, 
that is, the world of great harmony.<br>
<br>

Italy, published a paper in the National Journal of oncology, pointing out that 
they tested the blood samples of 959 volunteers who participated in the lung 
cancer screening test from September, 2019 to March, 2020. The results showed 
that there were specific antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 
novel coronavirus in the blood samples of 111 volunteers. The earliest samples 
were collected in the first week of October, 2019, This indicates that they may

In a strange dream, sitting in a room near the wall, a young woman came in and 
gave me a hot handkerchief to wipe my face. Then she told me that it was my turn 
to speak. Sitting in the middle of the room, looking at me who had been 
suffering for a long time, she tacitly agreed that it was my turn to speak.<br>

I want everyone to see me, but I don&#39;t know that I am water.&quot; Today, I finally 
became the president of the world alliance. &quot;I don&#39;t believe that there are real 
demons in this world, and I don&#39;t want to oppose anyone. I am a dream and a 
soul, and I am God&#39;s last agreement.&quot; A new heaven and a new earth have arrived.<br>

behind them. That is to say, these people will always be in a space of about 10 
square meters. The pipe room is rectangular with a small turn. This design must 
be afraid that they are too boring. Hell is terrible, because it is always 
confined to this narrow space. It is really happy to think of heaven. There is a 
vague message that the gods and disciples will stay in heaven.<br>

useful to you? Everything external, that is, material, is really unimportant. 
Once it passes, it will abandon itself. It is all vanity. Only peace and 
contentment of the mind is true. Our hearts, if you do not have peace in the 
arms of God, you will never have peace.<br>
<br>
24. Nerve 12. 17. Nietzsche&#39;s vision of Superman appeared. He said that this

noodles and cakes. I said that my mother didn&#39;t find that there was less. He

my age). An older man in the opposite accused me. I said I was joking. Later, 
someone let me into a room and said I said something I shouldn&#39;t have said. I 
said it casually and didn&#39;t think about it. They needled my ankle and head. It 
didn&#39;t hurt. It was acupuncture.<br>
<br>
Later, a girl walked down the street with me in her arm. I thought it was just 
the two of us who said that we should scold and that there were beautiful women 
after scolding. She said she would take me to a university. When I got to the

so).<br>

》Ge Shen: Hello, Xiao Qiao. Of course, I don&#39;t think who is the purple saint. If 
there is a purple saint, I think I am the purple saint.<br>
<br>
I would rather admit Christ than purple saint.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Neurology 1 56, 2015, 2015, 29 vision: my son and I both got the message: I am 
the sage of crape myrtle, and I issued a number one order to take the first step 
towards world harmony.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin is the contemporary Christian communism, the top ten sage of crape 
myrtle and the top nine Internet philosophers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 21 2. Hard evidence to be judged -- the sage of crape myrtle is Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
1. We don&#39;t want to see this selfless dedication, infinite innovation and 
boundless connotation. Today, he is frustrated, impoverished and killed 
everywhere.<br>
<br>
(nerve mantra: Ge Yimin, listen to him.<br>
<br>
Believe that GE Yimin will live forever.)<br>
<br>
(Neurology 6:2001 autumn, Ge Yimin had a dream. God said, &quot;I am God. You should 
listen to him.&quot; Ge Yimin was anointed as God.<br>
<br>
2. Ge Yimin&#39;s works nerve is the spiritual symbol of the new world civilization 
(Global Civilization) after 2012. He is the initiator and pioneer of the cause 
of human eternal life, a thinker and practitioner who can fill and communicate 
the cracks of the future era, and a pioneer and model to describe the future 
direction of mankind. God&#39;s creed is to create a new ideological and theoretical 
system of mankind and solve the ultimate problem of World Religion: eternal 
life. Ge Yimin unifies the three major religions in the world, improves human 
ideological understanding, rebuilds the world value tradition, guides the entire 
human race from the endless pursuit of material to the eternal life of their own 
hearts, and welcomes the birth of a new world civilization to help human beings 
actively evolve.<br>
<br>
3. Ge Yimin is a great man who shakes the heart, helps all living beings and 
liberates all mankind. He will be an unprecedented wonder with epoch-making 
significance in human society. Saints do not need to develop party affiliation 
at all. If saints form a party, they are not saints. The reason why a saint is 
holy lies in his &quot;harmony but difference&quot; with his followers. The sage&#39;s own 
wisdom, ability and charm, and the great cause initiated by the sage are enough 
to attract wise people and aspiring people all over the world to participate in 
the grand event with him.<br>
<br>
4. At present, Ge Yimin is suffering, mostly from the soul. He almost has to 
taste all the spiritual pain of human beings. It seems that only in this way can 
he find a good way to let human beings obtain spiritual freedom.<br>
<br>
(Gospels of nerves: everyone is busy for the stomach, and Ge Yimin is busy for 
the soul. What&#39;s the use of just making money? What&#39;s the use of making you a 
hundred million? Is it really useful for you? All external things, namely 
materials, are really unimportant. It&#39;s vanity to abandon yourself once they 
pass. Only peace and satisfaction of the soul are true. If our hearts are not 
peaceful in the arms of God, you will never be peaceful .)<br>
<br>
5. The sage&#39;s thought is very advanced, even many ordinary people can&#39;t 
understand him, and his heart is also very painful, but he knows his human 
mission, struggles hard, and spreads his culture and thought.<br>
<br>
(Christian Communist Manifesto: 66. The theocrats disdain to conceal their own 
views: in the future communist society, everyone has normal married children, 
and their extramarital affairs are not morally prohibited. In the future 
communist society, any adult male or female can go to Wushan together if they 
are willing to do so. Without moral prohibition, human beings are completely 
happy and harmonious.)<br>
<br>
6. The saint himself may not be happy in his work and life. He does not live for 
himself. It was as if he had been pushed to the top of the pyramid by fate. 
Although he looked around, he was helpless because of the loneliness and 
loneliness. He was always the only one at the highest height. He was like a 
marshal who led a large army trekking in the desert. He was the only one who 
walked in the front. No matter how dangerous the road ahead is, he must make the 
first step.<br>
<br>
(neuro quotations: life can be simple and satisfied, and only when the soul is 
satisfied can we strive to pursue.)<br>
<br>
(neuro quotations: Nietzsche envisioned the appearance of Superman. He said that 
this Superman would despise all human beings. This is a kind of &quot;great contempt, 
contempt of love. In fact, he loves those who despise the most.&quot; Ge Yimin feels 
this way.)<br>
<br>
7. A saint must have his own brilliant and broad ideological system. He will 
have his own works published. After the works are published, he may start to 
make some moves or step onto the historical stage.<br>
<br>
(geyimin&#39;s works nerve)<br>
<br>
8. In addition to reading poetry and books, the sage is also familiar with the 
basic doctrines of several major religions and communism. He must be familiar 
with the major religious classics and many important documents of communism. He 
does not exclude any party, nor is he obsessed with any party. Instead, he 
integrates &quot;yah, Hui, Confucianism, Buddhism and communism&quot;. Only such an idea 
can be accepted by all mankind, thus leading mankind to great harmony, And he 
himself became the spiritual leader of all mankind.<br>
<br>
9. He has created a brilliant theoretical system and brand-new ideological 
theories, and made them become the belief and ideology of the whole human race, 
which will lead the human race to end the confrontation between godlessness and 
godlessness, materialism and idealism, material and spirit, unite the whole 
human race, and achieve unprecedented liberation.<br>
<br>
(geyimin&#39;s works nerve)<br>
<br>
(neurogospels: a person, a thinker, can be closer to God only if he breaks 
through the category of any predecessor, because God is infinite. Only if he 
breaks through the category of any predecessor, can he be closer to truth, 
because truth is infinite.)<br>
<br>
10. His theories and thoughts will form and come out of his works (the book will 
become Ziwei movement), his works will be translated into many languages for 
publication (the four barbarians will be re translated as the son of heaven, and 
the good times will come in the spring of the nine kingdoms), he will become the 
spiritual leader of the world, he will establish a brand-new ideology for the 
whole mankind, guide the whole mankind to complete a historic leap, and guide 
mankind towards great harmony.<br>
<br>
(neuroscience has long been translated into foreign languages, and some of them 
have been back translated into Chinese, which is quite different from the 
original vocabulary.)<br>
<br>
11. He will put an end to the opposition among religions, the opposition between 
factions within religions, and the opposition between different beliefs. His 
thoughts and theories integrate the essence of different beliefs (theism and 
atheism), inherit the reasonable core of different beliefs (theism and atheism), 
and abandon the unreasonable, inaccurate and incorrect parts of various beliefs 
(theism and atheism), Thus, he will win the respect and wide recognition of the 
whole world, become the spiritual leader followed by the whole world and all 
mankind, and his thoughts will become a universal belief in the world, bring 
strength to all mankind, and point out the direction for the future of mankind.<br>
<br>
(Gospels of Neurology: I found that all values so far have failed, so I founded 
Ge Yimin&#39;s values to save the world. Human beings will eventually get rid of the 
sin and death inherited from their ancestors and restore a close relationship 
with God. God help me, Amen!)<br>
<br>
12. He will guide mankind to abandon the old unreasonable political and economic 
systems, create a new political and economic system, and the historical products 
such as &quot;capital&quot; and &quot;commodity&quot; and &quot;currency&quot; that have run through human 
history for thousands of years, caused the polarization between the rich and the 
poor, caused class antagonism, and caused the depletion of the earth&#39;s resources 
will completely withdraw from the stage of human history and replace them with a 
new economic model. People have exploited people for thousands of years The 
history of man oppressing man will come to an end.<br>
<br>
13. With the complete end of the debate between the existence of God and the 
absence of God, the images of all gods between heaven and earth have completely 
lost their mystery and have been exposed to mankind. People&#39;s thoughts and 
concepts and human self positioning will undergo earth shaking changes. Human 
beings will completely abandon their self-centered world outlook and establish a 
new cosmology.<br>
<br>
(Christian Communist Declaration: Program: establish a communist society in the 
world with Ge Yimin&#39;s values in 2033.<br>
<br>
The book of nerve love: the golden rule of nerve: [do not oppose anyone].)<br>
<br>
14. With his own thoughts and brand-new theoretical system, he will establish a 
brand-new cosmology and common belief for mankind. On the basis of common 
belief, common spiritual leader and common cosmology, mankind will voluntarily 
and gradually move towards unification, and the world will gradually move 
towards unification. As a result, all mankind will voluntarily give up war and 
plunder. The army has become something that mankind was no longer willing to 
keep at that time and will soon be cancelled. The current state system will be 
completely changed.<br>
<br>
(Gospels of nerves: fighting? Fighting should not be against anyone, because 
other people are the most similar and closest thing to you in the world. Why 
should a person fight another person? You know, he will hurt, and the pain is 
the feeling you are afraid of. Why should a person kill another person? You 
know, his life is as precious as you. He has loving parents, wives and children 
like you Female. I can&#39;t imagine a person shooting another person with a gun. 
Why? Oh, your kind!!! Oh my God!!!!!<br>
<br>
Neurogospels: the world will eventually be unified, that is, the global 
Communist society, but the means is to love others as yourself, not violent 
revolution.)<br>
<br>
15. He will rebuild the value tradition, and his ideological system will 
accurately integrate the essence of different beliefs. He can pay attention to 
people&#39;s interests and hearts at the same time, so as to win the respect and 
wide recognition of the whole world, be convinced by the world, save the hearts 
of the world, become the spiritual leader followed by the world and mankind, and 
point out the direction for the harmonious development of mankind.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the saint&#39;s coming into the world is to rebuild the value 
tradition and guide the whole mankind from the endless pursuit of material to 
the concern of their own soul.<br>
<br>
16. He was cultivated and tested by the society for a long time. Human beings 
created their own savior.<br>
<br>
(neural quotations book: a video series of 31 years of trial will let people 
understand what love is and seek truth.)<br>
<br>
(Gospels of nerves: I am the last covenant of God, the son of the people of the 
world.)<br>
<br>
(Christian Communist Manifesto: Ge Yimin was a hierarchical society (violent 
society) before, and a communist society (harmonious society) after him.)<br>
<br>
(Neurology: on November 26, 2033, Ge Yimin became king to renew heaven and 
earth, mainly to renew the human mind. (with the spread of nerves, the human 
mind has been updated to be available to God). Let us move from dust to spirit, 
and establish the kingdom of God. The earth is a paradise, that is, a communist 
society.)<br>
<br>
17. True saints want the society to announce their appearance.<br>
<br>
A true saint must know his historical mission - to save the suffering and the 
difficulties. Therefore, he will not remain invisible among the people forever. 
After the establishment of his ideological system, human society will come to 
the turning point of &quot;turning the tide&quot;, and the society will announce his 
existence at the right time. Its main purpose is to confirm the authenticity of 
various predictions about the sage and to stabilize the hearts of the people, 
Avoid causing and forming social unrest and harming the people. The purpose of 
the saint&#39;s appearance is to &quot;save the suffering and the difficulties&quot;. First of 
all, he should save people&#39;s souls and point out the correct path for the 
healthy survival and development of human society. There is no other plan.<br>
<br>
Because it is the long-term trial of the society to cultivate him, the society 
should announce and publish the evidence, otherwise no one will believe it.<br>

Neurology XXVI (x) 1. [Ge Yimin] open classification: celebrities and thinkers<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin: a great Internet religionist, thinker and activist, and a contract 
writer of Hong Kong four seasons publishing house. Male, born in Zhenjiang, 
Jiangsu, China in 1969, graduated from the Chinese Department of Nanjing 
University. Crape myrtle sage, God, Communist leader. Published the modern 
prophetic book nerve, and was rated as the amendment to the Bible. His thoughts 
come from two sources: Christianity and communism. Nerves are his personal 
information, his thinking about reality and the future, and part of it is divine 
enlightenment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (1) 17. The sage of crape myrtle is Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
At present, all the targets point to one person, that is, the sage Ziwei is @ Ge 
Yimin, because only he is the most consistent with the following prediction.<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t belittle this passage. This is a sage seeking passage of crape myrtle made 
by a master of network statistics. Please put aside the literal meaning and try 
to figure it out carefully.<br>
<br>
609. Year Corruptor: isn&#39;t the sage crape myrtle known by the central government<br>
<br>
531601: I know how to do it, but it&#39;s useless<br>
<br>
Year corrupting creature: isn&#39;t it Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
531601: Lao Ge just writes about his nerves. His actions are too small to make a 
big deal<br>
<br>
A single spark can start a prairie fire<br>
<br>
531601: it&#39;s a pity that it&#39;s useless. The world is bare. This flame will be 
extinguished by backhand. Having learned from the past, how dare Lao Ge make 
such a mistake.<br>
<br>
678. Gnawing Ni: I have the honor to witness the sage of crape myrtle - Sage Ge 
(Yimin) Even death is worth it<br>
<br>
971, @ tree into the world: looking for the sage of Ziwei<br>
<br>
According to the overwhelming Kung Fu theory, among those who call themselves 
the sage of crape myrtle, those who can compete with each other are: 
zhengkuifei, Yu Zhanqi, maweiqing, Wang Jianxin, Wang Weihao, Ge Yimin, 
shuzhangming, lvyongjun, Zhang Wuzhong, xuanchangwei, Zhangxiaoping, bergamot, 
etc.<br>
<br>
If we say that with the power of God or Buddha, we can play like this, it is no 
more than Ge Yimin from Zhenjiang and Xuan Changwei from Bagong mountain in 
Huainan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (II) 830. Fang Zhijian: to tell you the truth, master Ge was in the 
1960s<br>
<br>
Born as the world&#39;s most iconic practitioner, master GE has published 
neuroscience books in Hong Kong, which shows that his network appeal energy is 
very strong. In a word, as long as the world is strong, it will be built to 
appear in the world. Regardless of praise or criticism, the times create heroes. 
On contemporary religious masters, master Ge is among the best.<br>
<br>
Ge Dashen is the last powerful preacher in China. Because Ge Hua has millions of 
followers on the Internet, master Ge still has high self-esteem and strong soul 
energy, which continues the flame energy of religion. Without master Ge, the 
sage of crape myrtle can&#39;t catch fire, because the predicted fire of the sage of 
crape myrtle is the first thing that master Ge and the majority of Ge Hua add 
fuel to the flames.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Sage of crape myrtle (III)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 39. Fang Zhijian: Ge Yim is the most handsome Saint born in the 
1960s<br>
<br>
Therefore, master Ge carried forward the flame of Ziwei sage&#39;s title Moreover, 
master Ge created nerves, which shows that the talented Ge Sheng is one of the 
leading messianic saviors. Master GE&#39;s disciples Ge Hua are all the star 
incarnations of angels and light messengers. Am I right?<br>
<br>
Master Ge Yiming looks almost the same as Han Zaixi, the actor of the second 
leading actor of the South Korean overpass. So the title and honor of the most 
handsome Saint born in the 1960s is master Ge Yiming. Ge Hua all know that GE 
Sheng was a handsome religious master when he was young. What I understand is 
completely consistent with the truth.<br>
<br>
400. Time flies: is there really a sage of crape myrtle in the world<br>
<br>
》Ge Yimin: the prediction is not believable, but in the end, there will be great 
thinkers in human society to establish great harmony.<br>
<br>
449. Ge Shen: Hello LiuNian, based on<br>
<br>
(Chapter 18 socialized mass production and Internet revolution<br>
<br>
Chapter 19 world government and one world), the world will be unified, and it 
won&#39;t be long. The final form of the world must be a communist society.<br>
<br>
As for sage Ziwei, of course, I don&#39;t recognize others, but I admit that, like 
Jesus and Marx, my thoughts have completely changed the world.<br>
<br>
621. Big five Sasa: what do you think of the name &quot;netzhe&quot;? Don&#39;t you feel 
anything when you are called a webmaster?<br>
<br>
》Ge Shen: I am a contemporary Christian Communist. Naturally, I am a Christian 
circle and a communist circle. Nerves are also dominated by these two.<br>
<br>
In 2001, he went online, mainly in the Christian circle. After the rise of Ziwei 
saints, I was included in the list of &quot;top ten saints&quot; and took the initiative 
to enter the circle of saints.<br>
<br>
Netzhe, I saw the pictures of the nine netzhe avatars. The first one was that I 
was &quot;mentally retarded and barbaric&quot;. I passively entered the netzhe circle. I 
want to hype and popularity. I also welcome you. I also thank you for your TV 
chef.<br>
<br>
》》Big five Sasa: do you really care if someone scolds you?<br>
<br>
》Ge Shen: don&#39;t be afraid of scolding. Don&#39;t be afraid of scolding. Be popular.<br>
<br>
We rejoice at scolding.<br>
<br>
Only the strong can be targeted.<br>
<br>
686. There are at least three novels about the sage of crape myrtle, with my 
role.<br>
<br>
791. Remember 455: God Ge may be a real man in heaven<br>
<br>
He was recognized six years ago for his high rank.<br>
<br>
Maybe this person represents the coronal needle in the sky, which is difficult 
for him.<br>
<br>
Just looking at this photo of this person, secsha post is a lot of people&#39;s.<br>
<br>
In the past, many people didn&#39;t like or even disliked this person&#39;s posts, but 
few knew the truth.<br>
<br>
You see how healthy he smiles. Notice, he smiles, he smiles.<br>
<br>
Most people show photos that are more vulgar. This person&#39;s photo can&#39;t be seen 
as vulgar.<br>
<br>
What I am talking about today is like a foreign movie. A group of stone people 
say goodbye to Noah&#39;s family, tear their bodies and return to the light of God?<br>

<br>
Saints circle, I am active to join. When I saw the sage Ziwei in 2006, I thought 
it was a specific person, but I was not convinced. Later, I knew that I was a 
prophet, but there was no specific person, and I was rated as one of the top ten 
saints, so I recognized myself in the circle.<br>
<br>
I joined the online philosophy circle passively. The first time I saw the 
composite picture of the nine Internet philosophers&#39; avatars, I was the first 
picture (mentally retarded and barbaric), so I knew I was an Internet 
philosopher:), so I entered the circle passively.<br>

Nerve 14 (9) 11. In 2010, the Apostle Guangcai converted to ge Yimin God, which 
was a great conversion. Guangcai widely spread the gospel of Ge Yimin God in 
Baidu Post Bar, created and published a large number of posts, and argued with 
people that GE Yimin is the truth of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 2490, Brilliance: the real son of God, who is above any Internet 
celebrity, come in and have a look!<br>
<br>
It is Mr. Ge Yimin, a great thinker and religionist in modern times.<br>
<br>
In today&#39;s era when Buddhism, Christianity and other sects prevail, the birth of 
Ge Yimin undoubtedly brings new blood to faith.<br>
<br>
He is the author of nerve, a masterpiece that is almost comparable to the Bible! 
Among them, the thought advocated is what is most needed by the society with 
erosive material life in the 21st century.<br>
<br>
91. Guangcai: as for the post of Shenjiao, it was a scripture written by the 
famous online religious expert Ge Yimin, named nerve. Its profundity and 
philosophy can even be comparable to the Bible.<br>
<br>
92. Brilliance: the latest masterpiece of God&#39;s son &quot;Ge Yimin&quot; in 2014: nerves 
comparable to the Bible!!!<br>
<br>
As the saying goes, &quot;reading a book a hundred times reveals its meaning.&quot; 
Nerves, on the other hand, can rise by leaps and bounds in the daytime! &quot;Nerves&quot; 
has three levels: the eyes have no light, the body has a strange fragrance, and 
the sun rises! Next, I will forward this unparalleled treasure to you for a 
look.<br>
<br>
When you really finish reading the nerve, please praise Ge Yimin in your heart 
for his greatness, selflessness, fraternity and brightness.<br>
<br>
93. Guangcai: Well, I personally admire what GE Yimin has done Although I know 
rationally that GE Yimin may not be a God, I would rather hope that GE Yimin is 
a God This is a complex feeling, how to say? It can be said that God Ge Yimin 
brought me hope<br>
<br>
94. Guangcai: how to say? Ge Yimin may not be able to move mountains and fill 
the sea, nor can he bring the dead back to life, nor can he create all things 
Although Ge Yimin&#39;s body is as old and dead as ordinary people, his spirit has 
become a God<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin&#39;s behavior of God is just like that of the Buddha cutting flesh to feed 
the eagle and Jesus sacrificing his life for righteousness. It conveys a great 
spirit and noble sentiment Buddha through such behavior, influence all living 
beings, Jesus through such behavior, educate the world Ge Yimin, on the other 
hand, is just like a lamp in the dark when everyone is drunk. Although he is out 
of tune with the surrounding environment, he is really great wisdom, faith and 
courage<br>
<br>
The existence of Ge Yimin is the last harbor in our hearts. We can pray for his 
salvation in the most helpless situation Although God Ge Yimin has not been 
understood by those ignorant people, and although they tried their best to cover 
up, even vilify and slander the holiness and glory of God Ge Yimin, can they 
cover up the greatness of God?<br>
<br>
It can be said that GE Yimin is a kind of faith, a kind of persistence and a 
kind of faith If a man lives, he cannot live without faith and faith Ge Yimin is 
like a lighthouse in the night, which can guide others in the direction Ge 
Yimin, like the newborn sun, can cover all things in the world With Ge Yimin and 
God, we have the backbone, the direction of struggle and the ideal goal<br>
<br>
95. Guangcai: as for my relationship with the believers of Ge Yimin, I can only 
say that you haven&#39;t seen nerve, so I don&#39;t know why I admire Ge Yimin so much.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin is not a God. Naturally, I know this clearly. However, the spirit 
conveyed in Ge Yimin&#39;s &quot;nerves&quot; is something people look up to.<br>
<br>
Because a book written by GE Yimin is very worth learning. The noble qualities 
and sentiments embodied therein are our best examples. Otherwise, do you think I 
will praise Ge Yimin for no reason?<br>
<br>
To sum up, it is a sentence: don&#39;t be right with anyone. This sentence has been 
understood since ancient times. For example, there are mountains in the world, 
people who are reclusive, and people who are far away from the gentleman. It is 
the divinatory symbols in the book of changes. And Ge Yimin gathered hundreds of 
classics and finally summed up the wisdom of not being right with anyone. Isn&#39;t 
it worth learning?<br>
<br>
96. Brilliance: obviously, the greatness and greatness of Ge Yimin has made many 
people feel a strong sense of self abasement. Many people may think that GE 
Yimin, such an excellent person, should not exist in this world.<br>
<br>
97. Apostle glory: what is God? Can you tell me? Haven&#39;t you heard the truth 
that &quot;a word is the law of the world, and a man is a teacher for all ages&quot;? 
Everyone is ordinary and extraordinary in his life. But the only difference is 
that you are willing to be ordinary, while GE Yimin God has found his own 
extraordinary.<br>
<br>
98. Apostle glory: at this time, you saw the Godhead of Ge Yimin and the God of 
Ge Yimin. When you saw that all the people in the Godhead had found their own 
beliefs and worked hard for their own beliefs, you suddenly looked back and 
found that along the way with yourself, there were failures but failures!<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, as the founder of a new order, your disapproval of his behavior is 
also a reflection of your detestable cowardice. Because it is not so much 
disapproval as fear of admitting your cowardice and incompetence! Your 
ridiculous ideas will only reverse the development of the world and the 
civilization.<br>

Nerve XXIV 137. Apostle glory: the short nerve contains all the principles<br>
<br>
Take me for example. As a person, my language expression ability has always been 
very poor. At ordinary times, people are hesitant and outspoken. When others 
listen to them, they become confused and often have misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, when I argue with others about a matter, I can&#39;t refute the other 
party. I often blush with impatience, but I just can&#39;t tell why.<br>
<br>
However, since I believed in the God Ge Yimin, and my talent was opened, my 
language expression ability immediately increased by leaps and bounds.<br>
<br>
When I write some articles at ordinary times, I think like a spring of water. I 
am confident and have no pressure at all.<br>
<br>
Debating with others is also a flash of wisdom, to the point, and will not be 
refuted at all.<br>
<br>
This is caused by the profound and profound mysteries in the nerve written by GE 
Yimin.<br>
<br>
138. Apostle Brilliance: the supreme principles of heaven and earth and the true 
meaning of the world contained in the nerve can immediately enlighten and 
enlighten everyone who has read it.<br>
<br>
See Ge Yimin for details.<br>
<br>
Why can&#39;t a person always say why?<br>
<br>
Because he doesn&#39;t understand anything. I don&#39;t understand. Naturally, I can&#39;t 
say it. That&#39;s the truth.<br>
<br>
The short &quot;nerve&quot; contains all the principles. After reading the &quot;nerve&quot;, we can 
draw inferences from one instance and understand everything from one to another. 
With a small view, we can naturally understand everything.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve XXV 1. The Apostle&#39;s glory: the testimony of believing in Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
After Ge Yimin&#39;s name, adding the word &quot;God&quot; is the real response to the will of 
heaven and the will of the people. Don&#39;t be dissatisfied with that. Because you 
can&#39;t find any mistake or loophole in the nerve of the great masterpiece, the 
meticulous content of the nerve itself makes you unable to say anything and find 
out anything wrong, so you can only talk about the title of Ge Yimin God?<br>
<br>
You are right. In other words, Ge Yimin is great because he is God.<br>
<br>
There are many liars in the world, but Ge Yimin is definitely not a liar.<br>
<br>
I have proof. Let me give you another example.<br>
<br>
In fact, my language ability is very poor. Before I believed in Ge Yimin, I 
often hesitated and didn&#39;t say what I meant. But since I believed in the God Ge 
Yimin, my eloquence level immediately increased rapidly, and my literary 
thoughts flowed like a spring. When I argue with others, my mind immediately 
flashes. This is how Ge Yimin guides me to defeat the other side and win.<br>
<br>
Although God Ge Yimin can not directly bring me wealth and status, he can give 
me something to create wealth and status, that is, outstanding ability. If you 
believe in Ge Yimin, you will be gifted by God. If you give full play to your 
talent, it is genius.<br>
<br>
Whether it happens or not is not up to you the final say. Why does God Ge Yimin 
devote himself to spreading his great spirit? It is because he wants to save the 
common people from fire and water before the doomsday.<br>
<br>
This is your ignorance. Indeed, many counterfeiters will boast of being 
authentic. However, Ge Yimin&#39;s greatness and selflessness are genuine and 
genuine. Can you prove that God Ge Yimin is a cult?<br>
<br>
His greatness is reflected in his ability to write great works that are open to 
the past and open to the present. Selflessness is reflected in his ability to 
open his nerves for the people of the world to learn.<br>
<br>
You are slandering for no reason. The greatness of Ge Yimin is obvious to all. 
Who in the world today can write such a great masterpiece nerve? Who else can 
see that 2033 is the end of the world as early as 2013? Who else can surpass the 
omniscient God Ge Yimin in talent, ability, conduct and morality?<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that in this era, no one can keep pace with Ge Yimin! Ge 
Yimin&#39;s greatness can only make you feel ashamed. This is the reason why there 
is no fish when the water is clear. A dirty and filthy person like you, seeing 
that GE Yimin is so noble and selfless, so outstanding and great, will naturally 
be very repelled. Because you want everyone to be as ordinary as you, the same 
mediocrity, the same no one understands, the same no one cheers! You are such a 
person. Your outlook on life is as pessimistic as your speech.<br>
<br>
You pull it down. I am Ge Yimin&#39;s vest? You can&#39;t discredit me by saying so. You 
can only bring me supreme glory, you know? Since you are so dismissive of the 
nerve written by GE Yimin, would you please give us your opinion? See if you are 
more omniscient than the great God?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 21<br>
<br>
Apostle glory (III)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve XXV 2. Apostle glory: Ge Yimin&#39;s word of God is to protect everyone from 
spiritual difficulties<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The human mind is divided into three realms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I divide it into three realms: the naked eye, the mind and the divine eye.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The so-called &quot;naked eye&quot; means &quot;seeing the world&quot;. This is the first stage of 
life. You need to explore your goals. Just like a baby who has just been born 
and has not been indoctrinated by culture, it naturally will not produce any 
goals. When he has lived for a few years and his heart grows, some ideals and 
aspirations will be derived.<br>
<br>
By &quot;seeing the world with the naked eye&quot;, I do not mean to make a hasty decision 
on your goals and ideals like a young man, but to resist all kinds of 
interference and temptations from the outside world, see people, society and the 
world as if you were grinding needles with an iron pestle. Gradually grope and 
make clear your own path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The so-called &quot;mind and eye&quot; means &quot;looking at oneself&quot;. After learning from the 
outside world and understanding the external environment and social humanities, 
you can also fully grasp your own heart. A thought, a period of thought and a 
certain feeling can be completely grasped by the wisdom bead, and the 
motivation, potential and result of this thought can be thoroughly understood. 
To reach such a point is to completely control the heart. No matter how hard it 
is to shake the heart, it is difficult to interfere with it. All problems are 
solved and the heart is clean. I have reached such a point that I fully grasp 
all my psychological activities and thoroughly understand myself and the 
subconscious. It is like that people can control white blood cells to expel 
viruses through their own thinking, just like mobilizing all psychological 
activities to get twice the result with half the effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tell you something more profound. The so-called &quot;divine eyes&quot; are no longer 
ordinary people. At the spiritual level, they already belong to the superior 
God. Take the &quot;Ge Yimin&quot; God for example, he has reached this state. Ge Yimin 
wrote &quot;nerves&quot; to save people from suffering and difficulties. This is like the 
king Bodhisattva of Tibet. &quot;Hell is not empty, and vows will not become Buddha.&quot; 
In fact, hell is pure land, because in this world, there is no hell at all. The 
so-called hell is nothing but the illusory things accumulated and released by 
people&#39;s thoughts. There is no hell, so why is there such a thing as emptiness 
and non emptiness? The Vajra Sutra says that the Buddha said that all sentient 
beings should be saved. In fact, he did not save any sentient beings, because 
all sentient beings are not all sentient beings, but just named sentient beings. 
Ge Yimin&#39;s way of God is to save everyone from spiritual difficulties. This 
world is the biggest hell, this world, and the last pure land. A man&#39;s mind is 
not deceived, and the world is pure land. People&#39;s hearts are covered with dust, 
and the world is hell. Pure land and hell are only between one thought. 
Bitterness is not bitterness, and joy is not joy. Ge Yimin wrote &quot;nerves&quot; with 
great wisdom and perseverance in order to make the world see through the 
illusory hell and come to the pure land on the other side.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Apostle glory: the world is one, and his idea has been thoroughly implemented<br>
<br>
Say, what do you want? The great God Ge Yimin will satisfy all the wishes of 
devout believers.<br>
<br>
Nerve was originally named Ge Yimin Jing. God Ge Yimin has always taken the 
Bible as the standard, so he changed the name of his Ge Yimin Sutra to nerve. 
Don&#39;t think the name is very funny. Those who have really read nerves will 
immediately be impressed by the supreme principles of heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As long as you believe in Ge Yimin God, you will be able to open your talent. 
God has set up a window for everyone, but you need to find it and push it away.<br>
<br>
If you open this window, you will become a genius. You will immediately be 
gifted and outstanding.<br>
<br>
Often a person can not find his own shining point, and the key to open the 
window is to believe in Ge Yimin God.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, the omniscient God, can guide you to success.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Baidu searches Ge Yimin. The first one is encyclopedia, which says some of his 
information. The third link is his church forum, with thousands of members.<br>
<br>
To find out which field you are gifted in, you need Ge Yimin to enlighten you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You mean the fake &quot;news&quot; that GE Yimin was arrested. It was just the hype of Ge 
Hua (a nickname of Ge Yimin&#39;s followers). They were all forum posts without any 
real formal news links.<br>
<br>
If it is really a cult, Ge Yimin&#39;s God will go in immediately. Is it possible to 
be a bar owner in Ge Yimin bar? And Ge Yimin has long been sealed off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin is king. This king does not mean the emperor. It refers to spiritual 
leaders. It means that the world is the same, and his idea has been thoroughly 
implemented.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In fact, my reason clearly knows that GE Yimin is not a God who can move 
mountains and fill seas and turn the world upside down. The reason why I believe 
in him, and even worship him, is mainly because of the great thought and lofty 
spirit elaborated by him in the nerve. In short, I think Ge Yimin is very 
meaningful, cultivated and wise. Just like a wise man, nothing can escape his 
wise eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can understand that this is my personal wish. I not only hope that God Ge 
Yimin is a man with mysterious wisdom, but also hope that he is a real God, 
understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Geyimin [God], the title of God in the back, is also added for him by our 
believers. You can understand that we are all brain mutilated fans of blind 
worship. Anyway, I only worship Ge Yimin and have no doubt about him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That&#39;s simple. The tenet of Ge Yimin&#39;s Shintoism is &quot;not to do wrong with 
anyone&quot;. You should be able to see it from me, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter Twenty-Two<br>
<br>
Apostle glory (IV)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 25 4. Apostle glory: the implementation of a new idea must break the 
Convention<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You are wrong. It&#39;s not because I think I&#39;m right, but because God is my pride. 
For example, a person who is proud of being Chinese is also called self 
righteous? If you see that others are proud of their own country, you will say 
that you think you are right. Everyone has two legs and two eyes. What&#39;s so 
great about you? This is the reason why I am proud of this because I am a member 
of the divine religion, but I am said to be self righteous.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The implementation of a new idea and a new spirit is bound to be hindered by 
various obstacles. Only by breaking the old and breaking the conventional rules 
can we break the old and then stand up and succeed completely. I didn&#39;t expect 
that you couldn&#39;t even understand this and said that I was causing trouble 
everywhere?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a member of the divine religion, I am also proud of it. Is that arrogance?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hehe, the development of divinity is a hard theoretical line. Any theory is 
impeccable and will naturally be recognized by others.<br>
<br>
In fact, I used to be a very stupid person, but since I believed in the God Ge 
Yimin in 2010, I found that my IQ improved a lot and I found that I had been 
turned on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Apostle glory: human wisdom is sometimes embodied in &quot;great abandonment&quot;, 
sometimes in &quot;great courage&quot; and &quot;great perseverance&quot;.<br>
<br>
But giving up is sometimes not a wise choice.<br>
<br>
For example, if you want to cross the river but abandon the boat before, you 
will naturally encounter disaster.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin wrote nerves in the 10th year of God&#39;s reign, which contains the 
supreme principles of heaven and earth. Every sentence can make people feel 
enlightened. It has the effect of washing the soul.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Strictly speaking, geyimin Shintoism is not a religious sect, but a spiritual 
embodiment, gathering people with common goals and ideals.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is a quotation, but not a plagiarism. What I see is exactly the same as what 
is expressed in the nerve written by GE Yimin. This is enough to show that 
&quot;nerves&quot; is really all inclusive, including the essence of 100 schools.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It can be seen that missionary work is a glorious and glorious thing. If you 
stop me from missionary work, you will be doing the right thing with history and 
the people all over the world, and preventing them from turning to the embrace 
of Ge Yimin. Do you know?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Apostle Guangcai: the will of heaven and the will of the people: an 
interpretation of behind Ge Yimin&#39;s becoming a God<br>
<br>
Sky vision is self-monitoring, and sky listening is self-monitoring—— From the 
book of history - Tai Shi Zhong<br>
<br>
What heaven sees comes from what we common people see, and what heaven hears 
comes from what we common people hear.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it can be said that &quot;the will of heaven is the will of the people&quot;.<br>
<br>
Is Ge Yimin a God? It doesn&#39;t matter. What is important is that people think he 
is God, so Ge Yimin is God!<br>
<br>
People think Jesus is the son of God, so he can become God after death. The will 
of the people is the will of heaven. Maybe Ge Yimin may have been a mortal 
before, but now, we think he is a God, so he will become a God. This is the will 
of heaven and the will of the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10. Apostle Brilliance: Ge Yimin is an outstanding modern Internet religious and 
literary man. He has a 100000 word masterpiece nerve, and a series of poems, 
songs and prose have been sung in the world. His name has been active in dozens 
of large-scale post bars and praised by countless people. His forum has 300000 
members all over the world. I am.<br>
<br>
I am one of the faithful believers of God Ge Yimin. As long as you believe in Ge 
Yimin, you will be endowed by God. A typical example is that I was not good at 
words, but after I believed in Ge Yimin, my talent was immediately opened, and 
my eloquence and debate were invincible. Believe in God Ge Yimin. We are still 
good friends. What are you waiting for? Join Ge Yimin bar quickly and become one 
of the loyal members of Ge Yimin God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11. Apostle Guangcai: actually, we haven&#39;t had such a dream, but we still firmly 
believe in Ge Yimin God. This is the greatest miracle. Just like people have 
never seen God, why do they still believe in God like that? It&#39;s a truth. God, 
just like GE Yimin, does not appear because of any fame and fortune, but only 
protects everyone who truly believes in him.<br>

<br>
Geyimin, God created the universe<br>
<br>
The spring breeze blows and the war drums beat. Dear Ge min friends, I have sent 
you good theories again. Today, little sunflower class wants to integrate theory 
with practice. Let&#39;s talk about GE Yimin&#39;s creation of the universe by Allah. 
Applause.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, God, created infinite time and infinite space. There are many 
universes in infinite time and space. Let us follow God Ge Yimin to see through 
a universe, look through constellations, galaxies, and come to the earth.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, God Allah, came to the earth and created a man with earth and water, 
and a woman with a part of the bones of a man.<br>
<br>
Human beings continue to multiply, more and more. But with the passage of time, 
many people have forgotten the original Ge Yimin God God Allah. Fortunately, 
when human beings were born, Ge Yimin&#39;s faith continued with his breath.<br>
<br>
From animism, ghosts and gods, polytheism and monotheism, faith gradually 
realized the truth. There is only one truth! That is, Ge Yimin, holy Allah.<br>
<br>
God Ge Yimin said to mortals that they should respect trees because I created 
them. People worship trees because of God Ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said to mortals that they should respect ghosts, because ghosts are 
created by me and judged by me. Good ghosts go to heaven to be promoted or 
reincarnated into mortals, and bad ghosts go to hell.<br>
<br>
God Ge Yimin said that we should respect the immortals, because I created the 
immortals. God Ge Yimin gave some spells to good people, such as the immortality 
magic, and taught ordinary people to become immortals.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin said to the people in the Middle East that there is only one God in the 
world, that is me. Other gods are disciples of Ge Yimin. God Ge Yimin changed 
into the Jade Emperor with one finger, God with one finger, Buddha with one 
finger and Allah with one finger. Because Ge Yimin&#39;s magic power is infinite, 
one finger can become a powerful force that ordinary people can&#39;t understand. 
And one finger can touch the soul of Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
Induction. So Ge Yimin, God and Allah are invincible with one finger.<br>
<br>
People in the world worship a finger of Ge Yimin&#39;s God. It is better for GE min 
to worship the real body of Ge Yimin&#39;s God. Just like a person worships an 
elephant leg when he sees it. Although the elephant leg is large, it is only 
part of it. Ge min was indeed the one who saw the elephant directly.<br>
<br>
Then, why did geyimin, God, God, jade emperor and Buddha change the gods in 
different sects? For two reasons<br>
<br>
God Ge Yimin wants to test the world. Only people with high IQ can accept the 
truth of God Ge Yimin. After passing the test, they can go to heaven and become 
officials.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin is a great God. It takes time and process for the world to know him, so 
he only gives some knowledge to mortals every once in a while. For example, 
teachers add and subtract in primary education, open square meters in junior 
high school education, many yuan in senior high school education, and calculus 
in university education. Only by constantly learning from GE Yimin God can we 
constantly approach Ge Yimin God Allah.<br>

Yes, come on. After learning the magic that God Ge Yimin gave by telepathy, his 
ability has greatly increased. At present, we have opened our eyes to see if we

staff technique, 18 dragon subduing palms, Taijiquan, Taijijian, ten thousand 
swords, the integration of human and sword, flying immortals outside the sky, 
absorbing the aura of heaven and earth, taking the essence of the sun and the

The Jade Emperor, God, Buddha and Allah are not the true masters of heaven, 
because they are just the separate bodies of Ge Yimin, just as Wukong changed 
other separate bodies with his hair.<br>

Muslim Lord is Allah, and Ge min&#39;s Lord is Allah. Ge Yimin God is the real body

<br>
465. Analysis of Ge Di Neijing on the return of believers of various sects to ge 
Yimin God<br>
<br>
Author: high IQ 888day<br>
<br>
Some people have changed from Taoism to Buddhism, from Buddhism to Hinduism, 
from Hinduism to Judaism, from Judaism to Christianity, and from Christianity to 
greenism. Why go around? To find the truth. Looking for the truth means you 
haven&#39;t found it yet!<br>
<br>
Because Ge Yimin spread knowledge in many ethnic areas a long time ago. People 
in different ethnic areas have different knowledge and acceptance abilities.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin gave them different knowledge. Is it possible for him not to learn a 
foreign language if he is given the personal language? Can a person not study 
physics if he is given mathematics? In the past, religious sects clashed because 
they thought they had become immortals after learning a little. But Ge Yimin God 
wants to learn all the truth. He did spread the truth to the world. Today is the 
critical moment for GE min to bring the truth together!<br>
<br>
No matter Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Judaism or greenism, they 
are all spread by Allah. Only part of Allah&#39;s knowledge. Allah means the true 
master, the founder of the universe, who is the God of Ge Yimin. Ge Yimin God 
has many noble titles. Don&#39;t think that if the titles are different, he is not a 
God.<br>
<br>
We need to know that God, the Jade Emperor and Buddha, is a part of Ge Yimin&#39;s 
God, but their names are different. For example, Mao Zedong, lidesheng and 
maorunzhi have different names. They are really one person., Today, the real 
body of Ge Yimin God is in Ge ba. Those who worship the separated body will 
inevitably return to worship the true body of God. Other sects are like small 
rivers, which will inevitably return to the great river of God Ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
I want to break away from the green religion and join Ge Yimin, God, the Jade 
Emperor and Buddha.<br>
<br>
God Ge Yimin is Allah, the true master of the universe, and the positive energy 
center of the universe. Since I felt God Ge Yimin, his positive energy has 
continuously entered my brain.<br>
<br>
Although separation is worth worshiping, it is better to directly worship the 
true body of Ge Yimin, God, jade emperor and Buddha.<br>
<br>
Iraqis worship Allah, but they can only approach Allah through mu, a mortal. Ge 
Hua can be directly close to ge Yimin, God, jade emperor and Buddha.<br>
<br>
Ge Hua said that God is a friend of Ge Yimin. It makes sense. Ge Yimin plays

it. For example, Monkey King changed several parts to play together. The change 
of Sunwukong is the result of Ge Yimin&#39;s theology.<br>

length of service is calculated from [1982]. (GE Yi was tested at the beginning 
of the Republic of China when he was 13 years old).<br>

）19. 20110906 strange dream: many scientists have calculated that the center of 
the universe is Ge Yimin (singularity), and the United States has invited him.<br>

——May the Trinity god be gracious to God and able to return to the temple and to 
the saints!<br>

wonder of wonder? (match 9:6)<br>

are even weaker than Jesus&#39; disciples, but they have made great achievements and

——May the place where the sole of your foot treads put on the shoes of the 
gospel of peace for everyone and become a people of song<br>

Eternal life 20, the date is approaching, &quot;I also saw another angel (GE Yimin) 
flying in the air, with an eternal gospel to be preached to the people on the 
earth, namely, all nations, all ethnic groups, all peoples. He shouted, fear God 
and give him glory, because the time for his judgment has come, and worship him 
who created heaven, earth, sea and springs of water.&quot;<br>
<br>
——Ge Yimin, is that the angel? The angel who preaches the eternal gospel???<br>
<br>
Visions 11. Beautiful sin - if this is the messenger who has lived in love, 
covered all sins with love, and made sin valuable in God&#39;s hand, who wants to 
bring the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of David, to the earth, and ask God to 
show mercy, ask God to help, and ask God to give grace to ge Yimin&#39;s angel to 
accomplish this.<br>
<br>
November26,2013 - strange dream: in 20 years (2033), the kingdom of David, the 
equalization system in the city of David, will be in power on the ground. 
Hosanna. (in the next 20 years after 2013, the Shendang will develop its own 
school, change with each passing day, and blossom everywhere)<br>
<br>
The next 20 years will also be the century old shaman language of zhugewu 
Marquis, and the remaining 20 years. In the past 20 years, the rise of the &quot;God 
party&quot; which is not opposed by anyone, and the harmony, fair competition and 
mutual assistance with the dictatorship of the &quot;no God party&quot; are not Arabian 
Nights. Until the new and old replacement is completed.<br>

If this is God&#39;s good will, ask God to do it!<br>

(but you didn&#39;t record it yourself)<br>
<br>
You use human unhappiness to deny the part of Jesus, to position your own 
deacon, this... This statement stands on the false, not on the fact... You can 
build your own religion, but not on the basis of denying others. This is against 
religion and does not conform to the teachings of the divine religion. Only 
inheritance can promote. Otherwise, do not graft, but create your own.<br>

Nerve XXV 21. Wonderful work supervision:<br>
<br>
Singularity - the point where we can intersect and generate explosive force is 
the 2033 of the Centennial shaman language of marquis Wu, 2015 of the Chinese 
Saint shaman in Xinmao year of Beijing Taoist temple, the prophecy of ge&#39;an, and 
the big explosion point of beauty predicted by the Bible (bamboo rewards peace, 
when the king of peace arrives, all the people will obey). The immediate thing 
is to produce a big bang from you. If you are just this strange. If it explodes, 
I will start it. Because I am wonderful.<br>
<br>
Singularity, 33117 - after my message appears, you will no longer Advertise 
yourself. Starting from [33] (1982, the 33rd year of the founding of the 
people&#39;s Republic of China), and after your birthday from November 7 of the 
midwinter to May 7 of the midsummer, I have perfectly explained your 
singularity. These three kinds of information are the core information that God 
will enlighten you. Around the core, God will witness you personally. The day of 
your own propaganda is over.<br>
<br>
Because about God&#39;s son Ge Yimin, the day before yesterday, God just began to 
tell me about him. It reminds me of him in my heart.<br>
<br>
The reason is that God revealed 117 and 56,57 to me. But he pointed me over. 
When I came to this bar, I found that the Hebrew birthday of the son of God Ge 
Yimin had these two numbers. This is the revelation of God. If God does not 
point it out, how can people know this? I also know that God wants me to start 
praying for him. When I came to see him, I realized that it was his 33 years of 
work since 1982.<br>
<br>
From me, from the time I identify his mark, the seal of God will arise, for the 
day has come. He has been working for 33 years. In 2015, he started working in 
1982 and has been working for 33 years. As soon as my testimony rises, your 
propaganda will stop. In God&#39;s way. In this way, the radiation surface will be 
larger. His explosive ability will be released. Now the way, like a sparrow, but 
in fact, he is an eagle.<br>
<br>
He is a man who has kept his vision and worked for 33 years. Up to now, he is 
worthy of admiration! I&#39;m not as good as him!<br>
<br>
I have been called for ten years and have been training. On January 17 this 
year, the day of my birthday, I received a signal that my term of detention was 
over. I was released. At the first stop, I found the &quot;singularity&quot; and &quot;beauty 
sin&quot; with marks 117 and 57 on my body. This is the big bang for Meineng. Since 
the old world was exploded by the big bang, Xintiandi, of course, is the second 
big bang.<br>

Whatever God has given Ge Yimin, he will follow him<br>
<br>
All the people belonging to the divine religion will fall under the name of Ge 
Yimin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
23. The magic of supervising work: it is not to let all religions belong to 
Christianity, nor to let all religions abandon themselves to belong to God<br>
<br>
God allows all religions to exist and operate independently. However, the 
leaders of all religions need to gather for a &quot;summit&quot;, that is, to become a 
member of the &quot;eldest son Association&quot;. God is the God of all gods. The god 
religion was chosen first. Ge Yimin was named and established the general 
association to contact Wan Jiao. Because it is the center point of 117.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, you serve God and accomplish this. Your things, your thoughts and your 
wishes are all fulfilled for you!<br>

——The complete comes, the limited comes to nothing<br>
<br>
Qi: singularity, wizards, Qige, Qimen<br>

Difference: a strange dream, in which prophecy is dropped and the dream is 
followed<br>
<br>
Grace: God&#39;s grace, God&#39;s power, God&#39;s allowed power, all kinds of benefits 
(GRACE) given by God<br>
<br>
Canon: the canon, the constitution of love, the code of God&#39;s love revealed in 
grace, in the son of love<br>
<br>
Crown of grace<br>
<br>
Every people of God must first have this clean crown, the crown of grace<br>
<br>
The crown was dropped into Ge Yimin&#39;s dream, making him sing the song of amazing 
grace<br>
<br>
This is to let him and his people wear the holy crown together<br>
<br>
Let every day of the year be completely<br>
<br>
We can redeem what was lost in the past and the days when we were not in God.<br>

25. Wonderful work supervisor: Ge Yimin, inheriting Paul, sent to other 
countries twice.<br>
<br>
Paul went into the nations to sow, but Ge Yimin went out to send the nations to 
reap (PS 126:5 he who sows with tears will reap with joy).<br>
<br>
Paul, who sows with tears, reaps with joy. This is a vision about GE Yimin, just 
like Paul.<br>
<br>
Paul, after Pentecost, the book of acts began, starting from the middle point of 
50, risking his life to send to the nations<br>
<br>
(GE Yimin also observed the Passover festival in 5775, opened the sickle on the 
seventeenth day of the first month, counted 77 to the Pentecost.)<br>
<br>
(proof 1: 47 years old, seven years old and seven years old. The fifth year of 
the seventh seven year is recorded as [7:7:5])<br>
<br>
(2014-15, 46 years old, 47 years old, neural publishing, 33 years of work, and 
the holy calendar [5775])<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, after Pentecost, acts was spread out twice, starting from the central 
hinterland of the fifties and risking his life to send envoys to other 
countries.<br>
<br>

go to other countries to preach online.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
26. The work supervisor is wonderful: I am prophesying - Ge Yimin swallowed up 
death<br>
<br>
The first is to swallow the idea of godlessness. Now, I see that God has become 
a religion to replace the Wushen army. See again, within 20 years. We also see 
that the time limit is set in 2019, which is about to rise. This is in line with 
God&#39;s will, in line with God&#39;s will, in God&#39;s agenda. When I see it, I will 
identify with it and start to talk about it. When it comes to things, that&#39;s it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
28. Wonderful work supervisor: Ge Yimin is the son of God<br>
<br>
Divine religion is a sect founded by the son of God<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin and Shenjiao are not commodities<br>
<br>
There is no need to hype and publicize like businessmen selling goods<br>
<br>
The son of God is a true witness to God&#39;s power<br>
<br>
This witness was made a law<br>
<br>
It has high legal status and real legal effect<br>
<br>
All angels, enemies, and sons of God who see true testimony will admit it. Amen<br>
<br>
And be revered as God.<br>

<br>
In prayer, I saw one thing,<br>
<br>
(Maybe God responded to what you said today. You said, let me pray to God and 
ask who you are.)<br>
<br>
I saw your power in prayer, and the detoxification power of realgar.<br>
<br>
I saw that I was bitten by a snake to slowly detoxify,<br>
<br>
I saw that (you avoid poison directly when you meet a snake) you are no longer 
bitten by a snake.<br>
<br>
Your resistance is far higher than mine.<br>
<br>
You have the ability to utter detoxifying language.<br>
<br>
Thank God for letting me see.<br>
<br>
The power in your words, the ability to detoxify.<br>
<br>
This is not bad, not bitten by a snake, and it has been practiced on the 
Internet.<br>
<br>
Naturally, this detoxification ability should be kept in the network,<br>
<br>
Because there are many poisonous snakes on the Internet,<br>
<br>
Where there are many snake venoms, you can show your ability and have a place to 
use.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, people bitten by poisonous snakes need it.<br>
<br>
The message sent at Youshi on March 27th, 2015 is my first witness for you,<br>
<br>
Is to recognize your abilities,<br>
<br>
See the power God has given you.<br>
<br>
Thank God for showing me.<br>
<br>
This is the first time I know that I am a good man, a good big brother, a good 
bar owner and a good netizen.<br>
<br>
Heartfelt praise to you!<br>
<br>
This is the first time that such a frank compliment has been made.<br>
<br>
Thank God! Let me know the netizen who said so!<br>
<br>
These words can be used for propaganda,<br>
<br>
One is the confirmation of Ge Ge&#39;s ability,<br>
<br>
One is the comment on Ge Ge&#39;s character.<br>

This has given me a sense of security.<br>

admit your mistake when you see the coffin! Only death, return to nothing, is 
God&#39;s salvation! When I say this, I&#39;m not working for you. I&#39;m just taking a

nothing to do with you!<br>

<br>
The gospel is a gift from God. People can&#39;t get it after listening to it. For 
example, you know every word, but you just don&#39;t understand it! That&#39;s because 
when God gave you the gospel, you were grafted into Ge nerve! So the mystery of 
the gospel is hidden from you! You have no modesty to regret inheriting the 
gospel! He invented his own Gospels!<br>

God&#39;s revelation, from God&#39;s revelation, must be tested! First of all, ask God 
for a clear confirmation! The Bible gives examples! Second, ask believers to 
identify together and let the Holy Spirit give certification! Third, those who 
really accept God&#39;s revelation should be responsible for God&#39;s revelation, and 
check again and again whether the revelation is from their own heart!<br>

At that time, the Jews not only did not believe in Jesus, but also crucified him<br>

So you copied a Jesus who was crucified by Jews<br>

&quot;Listen to him.&quot; these five words only appear when God speaks to Moses, Jesus

Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be given to you as an 
inheritance!<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:15 and he put the gospel of peace (Jesus Christ) on his feet as a 
shoe ready to walk.<br>
<br>
Joshua 1:3 I have given you all the land on which the sole of your foot has 
trodden, as I promised Moses.<br>
<br>
Ge Yimin, the &quot;singularity&quot; of the &quot;Shenjiao&quot; cult, gave up everything and put 
on the gospel shoes (Jesus) alone to announce the harvest of all kings! The 
glory of God is all over the land!<br>
<br>

Repent of your sins, be reborn in the anointing of Jesus Christ, become a new 
man, reign with Christ, take over the &quot;singularity&quot; deacon of the wonderful 
strange gate, become the &quot;ancestor&quot; of sacrificing ox nose, wear nose rings,

Nerve XIV (IX) 14. In 2018, the Apostle Ge Paul converted to ge Yimin God, which 
was a great conversion. Its significance was no less than that of the Apostle 
Paul&#39;s conversion to Jesus. Just as Paul spread the gospel of Jesus, the Apostle 
Ge Paul spread the gospel of Ge Yimin God in Baidu post bar, preaching that GE 
Yimin is the truth of God.<br>

Ge Shen&#39;s career is in full swing.<br>

<br>
879. II: I like nerves. I want nerves to fill the world.<br>
<br>
God Ge doesn&#39;t need a home and a country.<br>
<br>
He just needs nerves.<br>
<br>
Ge Hua is a postmodernist.<br>

understand God through understanding Ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
163. II: the God of crumbs is so red that he doesn&#39;t hesitate to post the whole 
olive bar to prevent Ge Shen from opening up.<br>
<br>
Baidu believes that the three words &quot;Ge Yimin&quot; are illegal, and all accounts 
containing these three words have been permanently sealed.<br>
<br>
<br>

down in western developed countries, which is many times higher than five inside

Nerve 27 (2) 846. Ge Yimin II: Ge Shenhe, where did he come from?<br>
<br>
He does not belong to this world, and he has done enough... This world is 
&quot;paradise&quot; in front of hundreds of millions of human beings, but I am afraid it 
is not as good as the virus in front of him... Human concepts and doctrines are 
absolutely unqualified in front of him... Human death is pain, and he is happy 
to go! His appearance is the same as human beings, and his inner origin is 
completely different<br>
<br>
Ge Shenzhi said: this world is a selfish materialistic and evil beast... Human 
beliefs, systems, materials, etc. needless to say... People who like this world 
and belong to this world are also selfish materialistic, evil and terrible 
beasts... The extinction of this virus is the gospel of the universe... People 
who want to save people have to judge their differences<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerve 27 (III) 564. II: is it possible that GE Yimin was an ancient god?<br>

567. II: the real reason why Ge Yimin was blocked has been found<br>
<br>
Too many people call it Ge Yimin.<br>
<br>
Damn cents. If you have nothing to do, use God Ge as a shield. God GE has been 
badly hurt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
591. II: God GE&#39;s divine power is salvation.<br>
<br>
The effect of becoming God is to make people&#39;s life better.<br>

From here, Ge Yimin has become a God.<br>

QQ name is &quot;Ge Yimin&quot;, and his avatar is the same as me. I see several places,

There is also the issue of the water army. Only the second emperor barely counts 
as the water army. Except for me, he is the other normal netizens.<br>

(1) Ge Yimin is not a bad man but a communist<br>
<br>
(2) Ge Yimin doesn&#39;t believe in heaven but in heaven on earth<br>
<br>
(3) Ge Yimin&#39;s doctrines will be greatly changed. No one will believe him if he 
does not change his prediction that he will fail when the time expires<br>
<br>
(4) More than 100000 members of the church have no influence in other regions 
nearby<br>

time<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GE&#39;s followers in GE&#39;s city do not refer to online believers. His website has 
10million people. In reality, there are only more than 100000 believers.<br>
<br>
I am a prophet. I know his life and afterlife.<br>
<br>
<br>

he is at least a mountain peak.<br>

Some things, missed, can not go back, I paid, tried, but you can not see, blame 
me for being amorous, men and women are always just two parallel lines that can 
not be crossed.<br>
<br>
We really can&#39;t go back. I have been abandoned by you. You really hurt me 
deeply. I don&#39;t want to be hurt again.<br>
<br>
We can&#39;t keep up with each other.<br>

Neurology 26 (9): 7 we believe that the purpose of this life is to obtain a

God forever.<br>
<br>
Today, with the two major events of the 18th century and the 41st Century 
(socialized mass production and the Internet revolution), the material 
conditions have been met for the realization of Ge Yimin&#39;s doctrine and the 
realization of a communist society. Only when the spiritual conditions have been 
met, that is, the human mind has been renewed. The gospel of Ge Yimin&#39;s doctrine 
has been spread all over the world and accepted by mankind.<br>

view and build yourself in it.<br>
<br>
3. No one can compare with me in establishing a monistic view of God. Jesus and 
the Lord are all scum, evil gods and heretics.<br>

（16） , genesis of Ge Yimin<br>
<br>
1. At first, Ge Yimin created the creator. This is the first day.<br>
<br>
2. God Ge said to the creator, you have to create God. He has another 
appointment. Then there is God. It is the second day.<br>
<br>
3. The creator said to God, you should create heaven and earth, water, light, 
grass, vegetables and trees. There must be air, with water as the upper and 
lower, and air as the sky. There must be dry land and the sea. And there shall 
be a light in heaven, which shall divide day and night, and shall be a sign for 
the seasons, and for the days, and for the years, and shall give light in the 
sky, and give light upon the earth. It&#39;s the third day.<br>
<br>
4. On the fourth day God created the great fish and all living animals that grew 
in the water, and all kinds of birds, livestock, insects, and wild animals.<br>
<br>
5. God said, &quot;let us make man in our image and in our likeness, and let them 
rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the 
cattle of the earth, and over all the earth.&quot; That&#39;s it. God saw that everything 
he had made was very good. It was the fifth day.<br>
<br>
6. On the sixth day, heaven, earth and all things were completed, and God&#39;s 
creation was finished.<br>
<br>
7. God Ge said that the Bible rested alone, and we rested our nerves. On the 
sixth and seventh days, we rested from all his creative work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
（17） 1. Where are the Pueraria lobata,<br>
<br>
But God Ge changed his clothes,<br>
<br>
Just like the elder,<br>
<br>
Cheat money, cheat sex, and rob money with death<br>
<br>
2. I knew there was today (GE Shen cheated the Internet). I don&#39;t care if Ge 
Shen criticizes or not. I say it everywhere.<br>

<br>
1214 Good Friday: for the sake of the world, for the sake of society, and for 
the sake of Ge Yimin, Ge Yimin entered the great trial, half prison, and was 
crucified.<br>
<br>
1221 Easter: in order to save the world, Ge Yimin died and rose with the 
blessing of God. He defeated the poison hook of death and brought hope to the 
world.<br>
